Chili Tumeric Hot Sauce
  --Sana Javeri Kadri

1/2 oz whole Sannam Guntar Chillies (~15–20 chillies), stems removed
1 1/2 c boiling water
1/2 c coconut vinegar
3 large garlic cloves, roughly chopped
2 tsp agave syrup
3/4 tsp Pragati Turmeric
1/2 tsp kosher salt

Place the dried chillies in a medium bowl and cover with boiling water. Cover the bowl with plastic wrap and let sit until the chillies are plump and rehydrated, ~30–45 min. Drain the chillies and place them along with the rest of the ingredients in a blender. Blend until smooth, taste and adjust seasonings, if necessary. Transfer to an airtight container or jar and refrigerate 24–48 hr.
