Chocolate Buttercream Frosting
  --Sally's baking addiction

1 c (230g) unsalted butter, softened to room temperature
3  1/2 c (420g) confectioners' sugar
1/2 c (45g) unsweetened natural or dutch-process cocoa powder
3 tbsp (45ml) heavy cream or milk
1/4 tsp salt
2 tsp vanilla 

With a handheld or stand mixer fitted with a paddle or whisk attachment, beat the butter on medium speed until creamy ~2 min. Add confectioners' sugar, cocoa powder, heavy cream, salt, and vanilla extract. Beat on low speed for 30 s, then increase to high speed and beat for 2 full min. Add up to 1/2 c more confectioners' sugar if frosting is too thin or another tbsp of cream if frosting is too thick.

Notes: Cover tightly and store for up to 1 week in the refrigerator or up to 3 months in the freezer. After freezing, thaw in the refrigerator then beat the frosting for a few seconds so it's creamy again. Makes 2.5 c. This recipe is enough to frost 12-16 cupcakes or one 9x13" quarter sheet cake.
- would probably add more cocoa, felt the chocolate taste was a bit light
