Cheesy Baked Pumpkin Pasta with Kale4
  --Sarah Jampel

Butter, for greasing the pan
1 lb medium pasta shells or tubes, like conchiglie rigate or penne
1 bunch kale (~1 lb), ribs removed, chopped into bite-size pieces
1/2 tsp red-pepper flakes
1 heaping tbsp chopped fresh rosemary + more for garnish
1 heaping tbsp chopped fresh thyme + more for garnish
~1 heaping c coarsely grated Parmesan
~1 heaping c coarsely grated Gruyère
~1 heaping c coarsely grated Fontina or mozzarella
15 oz can pumpkin purée
2 garlic cloves, peeled
1 tsp kosher salt + more for pasta water
1/2 tsp black pepper
1/2 c heavy cream
1/4 c vegetable broth
1/2 c whole-milk ricotta

Heat oven to 500 F and butter a shallow 2 qt/9x13" baking dish. Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil. Cook the pasta in the boiling water for 4 min, adding the kale for the last minute. Drain the pasta and kale, rinse under cold water, then transfer to a large bowl along with the red-pepper flakes and the chopped herbs. In a blender, add the pumpkin, garlic, salt, pepper, cream and vegetable broth. Blend until smooth. (If you don’t want to use a blender, add the pumpkin, salt and pepper to a large bowl and use a spoon to break it up into a smooth mixture. Slowly whisk in the cream and vegetable broth until mixture is smooth, then grate in the garlic.) Add the sauce to the bowl with the pasta. Add in most of the grated cheese, reserving ~1/2 c, and stir to coat. Transfer the pasta into the baking dish, then dollop the ricotta over top and sprinkle remaining grated cheese. Bake for 10-15 min, until brown and bubbly. If you want the pasta really browned, broil it for 3-5 min, watching carefully. Allow the dish to cool for 5-10 min, and garnish with additional chopped herbs before serving. 


Notes: sautee the kale with garlic and red pepper flakes before adding it to the pasta.
