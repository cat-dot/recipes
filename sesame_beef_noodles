Saucy Sesame Beef Noodles
  --Caroline Chambers

Kosher salt

1 lb spaghetti (or any long noodle)
1 medium yellow onion
2" piece fresh ginger
4 garlic cloves
4 tbsp sesame oil
1 lb shaved beef (or 1 lb sirloin or rib eye steak, sliced as thinly as possible)
10oz bag shredded carrots
1/4 c low-sodium shoyu
1/4 c rice vinegar
2 tbsp tahini
2 tbsp sriracha, sambal oelek, or gochujang
1 1/2 tbsp honey
1 tbsp fish sauce
chopped fresh cilantro and/or basil, sesame seeds, chopped peanuts, more sriracha (optional toppings)

Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil. Add the spaghetti and cook according to the package instructions. Scoop out 1 c of the pasta cooking water, then drain the pasta and return it to the pot. Meanwhile, thinly slice the onion. Grate the ginger (no need to peel it first) and garlic. Warm 2 tbsp of the sesame oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat. When it shimmers, add the sliced onion and cook, stirring often, until softened, ~4 min. Add the remaining 2 tbsp sesame oil, then when it shimmers, add the beef, peeling apart the pieces, the carrots, and the ginger and garlic, and cook, stirring often, until the steak is almost cooked through but still slightly pink in the center, 3-4 min. Scooch everything over to one side of the skillet. To the empty side of the skillet, add 1/2 c of the cooking water, shoyu, vinegar, tahini, sriracha, honey, and fish sauce. Stir it all together until combined, then stir it together with the beef and carrots. Cook until the sauce thickens a bit, another min. Transfer everything from the skillet into the pot with the pasta and stir to coat. Add more splashes of cooking water as neededâ€”the sauce should be glossy and stick to the noodles. Taste and add salt if needed. Divide among bowls and serve with any toppings that make you happy.
