1 1/2 c water
1 1/4 c + 2 tbsp canned coconut milk, divided
2 tbsp + 1 tsp sugar, divided
2 1/4 tsp table salt, divided

1/2 c salted dry-roasted peanuts, chopped coarse

Combine rice, water, 1 c coconut milk, 1 tbsp sugar, and 3/4 tsp salt in large saucepan. Bring to boil over high heat. Reduce heat to low to maintain bare simmer. Cover and cook until liquid is absorbed, ~20 min. Remove saucepan from heat and let sit, covered, for 10 min. Mix rice gently but thoroughly with rubber spatula. Meanwhile, whisk vinegar, pepper flakes, 1 tbsp sugar, and 1 tsp salt in bowl until sugar is dissolved. Add cucumber, peanuts, and cilantro and toss to combine. Let stand until ready to serve, tossing occasionally. Cook curry paste, 1 tbsp coconut milk, remaining 1 tsp sugar, and remaining 1/2 tsp salt in 12" nonstick skillet over medium-high heat until mixture is dry, ~3 min. Add shrimp and cook, stirring occasionally, until shrimp are opaque throughout, 4-5 min. Stir in remaining 5 tbsp coconut milk. Bring to simmer, then remove from heat. Serve shrimp with coconut rice and cucumber relish.
