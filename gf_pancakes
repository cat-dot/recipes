Gluten Free Pancakes
  --Beth Lipton

1/2 c blanched almond flour
1/2 c arrowroot
1/2 tsp baking powder
1/4 tsp fine sea salt
2 eggs
1/4 c applesauce
1/2 tsp vanilla (optional)
oil/cooking spray/ghee for griddle

In a bowl, whisk together almond flour, arrowroot, baking powder, and salt. In a separate bowl, whisk eggs, apple sauce, and vanilla. Stir egg mixture into almond flour mixture until just combined. Warm a griddle over medium-low heat. When warm, mist with cooking spray or brush with ghee. Drop pancakes by scant 1/4 c, spreading evenly. Cook until undersides are golden, 2-3 min, then flip and cook until cooked through and golden on both sides, 1-2 min longer. Serve warm with maple syrup.
