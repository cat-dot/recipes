Chewy Oatmeal Cookies
  --America's Test Kitchen

1 c (5 oz) ap flour
3/4 tsp salt
1/2 tsp baking soda
4 tbsp unsalted butter
1/4 tsp cinnamon
3/4 c (5 1/4 oz) dark brown sugar
1/2 c (3 1/2 oz) sugar
1/2 c vegetable oil
1 large egg + 1 yolk
1 tsp vanilla
3 c old fashioned rolled oats
1/2 c raisins (optional)

Adjust oven rack to middle position and heat oven to 375F. Line 2 rimmed baking sheets with parchment paper. Whisk flour, salt, and baking soda together in medium bowl, set aside. Melt butterin 8" skillet over medium high heat, swirling pan occasionally, until foaming subsides. Continue to cook, stirring  and scraping bottom of pan, until milk solids are dark golden brown and butter has nutty aroma, 1-2 min. Immediately transfer butter to large heatproof bowl, scraping skillet with spatula. Stir in cinnamon. Add sugars and oil to butter and whisk until combined. Add egg, yolk, and vanilla and whisk until mixture is smooth. Using wooden spoon or spatula, stir in flour mixture until fully combined, ~1 min. Add oats and raisins, if using, and stir until evenly distributed, mixture will be stiff. Divide dough into 20 portions, each ~3 tbsp. arrange dough balls 2" apart on prepared sheets. Using damp hand, press each ball into 2 1/2" disk. Bake 1 sheet at a time, until edges are set and lightly browned and centers are still soft but not wet, 8-10 min, rotating sheet halfway through. Let cookies cool on sheet on rack for 5 min, then transfer to rack and let cool completely.

Notes: if you omit the raisins, this recipe will yield 18 cookies, not 20.
