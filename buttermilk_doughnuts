Buttermilk Doughnuts
  --Cook's Illustrated

3 1/2 c unbleached ap flour + exrta for surfaces
1 c sugar
1/2 tsp baking soda
2 tsp baking powder
1 tsp salt
1 1/2 tsp fresh grated nutmeg
3/4 c buttermilk
4 tbsp unsalted butter, melted
2 large eggs
1 egg yolk
6 c vegetable shortening for frying

Mix 1 c flour, sugar, baking soda, baking powder, salt, and nutmeg in bowl of stand mixer fitted with paddle attachment. Mix buttermilk, butter, and eggs in 2 c pyrex measuring cup. Add wet ingredients to dry, beat on medium speed (#4 on kitchen aid) until smooth, ~30 s. Decrease speed to low (#2 on kitchen aid); add remaining flour and mix until just combined, ~30 s. Stir batter once or twice with wooden spoon or rubber spatula to ensure that all liquid is incorporated. The dough will be moist and tacky. Fit candy thermometer to side of cast iron kettle or large heavy bottomed soup kettle; gradually heat shortening over medium high heat to 375F. Meanwhile, turn dough onto flour work surface. Roll with heavily floured rolling pin to 1/2" thick. Stamp out dough rings with heavily floured doughnut cutter, reflouring between cuts. Transfer dough rounds to jelly roll pan or wire rack. Gether scraps and gently press into disk; repeat rolling and stamping process until all dough is used. Cut doughnuts can be covered with plastic wrap and stored at room temp up to 2 hrs. Carefully drop doughnut rings into hot fat 4-5 at a time. Turn as they rise to surface with tongs, a skimmer, or slotted spoon. Fry until golden brown, ~50 s per side. Drain on paper towel lined pan or wire rack. Repeat frying, returning fat to temp between each batch.


Notes: For a bit more flavor, add 2 oz of lard to every cup of shortening. Add 1/4 c more flour to make a chewier doughnut. Can coat with confectioners' sugar or cinnamon sugar. Best served right after frying.
