Cauliflower Ragu
  --Joshua McFadden

1 large head cauliflower or romanesco (1 1/2 - 1 3/4 lbs)
evoo
3 garlic cloves, smashed and peeled
1/4 tsp dried chili flakes
1 medium yellow onion, diced
1/2 c dry, unoakded white wine
1 big sprig rosemary
kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper
12 oz fusili or other spiral or tube shaped pasta
1 c freshly grated parmigiano-reggiano cheese
3 tbsp unsalted butter
1 tbsp lemon juice

If the cauliflower still has outer leaves and they look fresh, chop them. Cut the center stem from the cauliflower and cut the head into small florets. Chop the stem into small chunks. Heat 1/4 c olive oil, garlic, and chili flakes in a large deep skillet or dutch oven over medium high heat. Add ~2/3 of the cauliflower florets and chopped stems and the onion. Add the wine, 1 c water, rosemary sprig, 1 tsp salt, and several generous twists of black pepper. Tumble everything together. Cover the pan and adjust the heat to the mixture simmers nicely. Cook until cauliflower is fairly tender, ~25 min, stirring and smashing with a wooden spoon a few times as you cook. Add the rest of the cauliflower and 1/2 c water and cook until the second batch of cauliflower is very tender. This second cooking should take another 20 min or so. The ragu should be loose but not watery, add more water if it seems dry or tight. Meanwhile, bring a large pot of water to a boil and add salt. Add the pasta and cook until 2 min shy of al dente per package instructions. With a ladle or measuring cup, scoop out ~1 c of cooking water and set aside as you drain pasta. Add the pasta to the ragu, along with the cheese, butter, and lemon juice and fold everything together. Taste and adjust seasoning as needed; adjust the texture to make it creamy by adding some reserved pasta water. Serve immediately.
