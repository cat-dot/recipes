Pasta with Pistachios, Lemon, and Broccoli

1 c shelled pistachios
1 tbsp kosher salt + extra for pasta water
1½ lb medium tube-shaped pasta (such as maccheroni or penne)
1 large head broccoli, stems trimmed
2 garlic cloves
Juice and zest of 1 Meyer lemon (or zest of 1 regular lemon with 3 tbsp lemon juice and 1 tbsp orange juice)
1 tsp red pepper flakes
1 c flat-leaf parsley leaves
½ c mint leaves
1½ c evoo
½ c finely grated Pepato or Pecorino Romano cheese
2 tbsp finely chopped chives
Sea salt
Fennel pollen (optional)

Preheat the oven to 350°. On a rimmed baking sheet, toast the pistachios until fragrant and lightly toasted, 5-6 min. Transfer to a large plate and cool, then coarsely grind in a food processor. Transfer the ground pistachios to a bowl and set aside. Bring a large pot of water to a boil. Add some kosher salt and the pasta and cook until almost al dente, about 8 min. When the pasta is almost finished, add the broccoli to the pot and cook for 2 min more  or until the pasta is al dente and the broccoli is tender. Reserve 1 c of the pasta water drain the pasta and broccoli through a large colander. In the same food processor, combine the garlic, lemon zest, red pepper flakes and kosher salt and grind into a fine paste. Add the parsley and mint and pulse to make a rough paste. With the motor running, slowly drizzle in the olive oil. Transfer to a medium saucepan and stir in the ground pistachios. Add the pasta water to the pesto; bring to a boil and simmer for 2 min. In a large bowl, combine the pasta, broccoli and pesto. Stir in the lemon juice and set aside for 5 min. 

To serve, divide the pasta among plates or bowls and garnish with the grated cheese, chives, sea salt and fennel pollen, if using.
