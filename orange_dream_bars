Orange Dream Bars
  --Dorothy Kern

Crust:
1 c unsalted butter
2 c ap flour
1/2 c sugar
1/4 tsp salt

Preheat oven to 350F. Line a 9x13‚Äù pan with foil or parchment paper and spray with nonstick cooking spray. Beat butter with a hand or a stand mixer until creamy, then add the flour, sugar, and salt and beat until a dough forms. Press the crust into the bottom of the prepared pan. Bake for 18 min.

Filling:
1/2 c fresh squeezed oj
1 tsp orange zest
1 1/2 c sugar
1/4 c ap flour
1/2 tsp baking powder
4 large eggs
powdered sugar for dusting

Place all filling ingredients into a blender jar and blend until smooth, a few seconds to almost a minute, depending on your blender. Carefully pour filling over evenly over hot crust. Return to oven and bake until the top is no longer jiggly, ~20-23 min. Cool completely before dusting with powdered sugar and slicing into bars.


Notes: double oj and cook it to reduce down to get more orange flavor.
