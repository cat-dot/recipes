  --Roseanne Smith

2 tbsp flaxseed meal
⅓ c hot water
3 bananas
⅓ c olive oil
⅔ c maple syrup
1 tsp vanilla extract
1 tsp baking soda
1 tsp salt
1 tsp cinnamon
1⅓ c almond flour
⅓ c tapioca flour
⅓ c buckwheat flour
3 tbsp millet
⅔ c toasted walnuts
1 banana, sliced lengthwise
¼ c turbinado sugar

Spray an 8" loaf pan and preheat oven to 350F. In a small bowl, stir together the flaxseed meal and hot water. Set aside. Mash the bananas into large chunks, making sure not to mash into a purée. In a medium bowl, stir together olive oil, maple syrup, vanilla and flaxseed meal mixture until smooth and even. Add this mixture to the mashed bananas using a spatula, making sure the mixture comes together well. In a separate bowl, stir together baking soda, salt, cinnamon, almond flour, tapioca flour and buckwheat flour. Add the dry ingredients to the wet ingredients, half at a time, using a spatula. Add the millet and toasted walnuts and stir until evenly combined and distributed. Pour half of the batter into the prepared pan and lay one-half of the banana on top. Pour the rest of the batter into the pan and lay the remaining slice of banana on top with the inside facing up. Sprinkle the top generously with turbinado sugar. Bake for 55-60 min, rotating halfway, until cake tester comes out clean. Let cool before slicing.
