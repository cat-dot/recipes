6 ripe plantains
1/2" piece ginger
1/2 white onion, chopped
2 cloves garlic, chopped
1 tsp nutmeg
1 tsp cayenne pepper
1 tsp anise seed
1 tsp salt
oil for frying

Cut a shallow line down the length of the plantain and peel back the skin. Chop the plantain into small cubes of ~1". Grate the ginger into a large bowl then add in garlic and onion. Blend in cayenne, anise seed, nutmeg, and salt; mix well. Add in plantains and toss to coat. Leave to rest for 30 min. In a deep skillet, add enough oil to slightly submerge the plantains and heat to 350F. Separate the plantains into batches so that each lot can fry without touching on another. Add each batch into the skillet to brown, turning once during the porcess. Should take ~5 min per batch. Use a strainer ladle to remove the plantains from the pan and rest on a plate covered with paper towels. Lightly dab and serve immediately.
