Classic Boule

6 1/2 c (975g) bread flour (preferrably from Hayden Flour Mills) + more for dusting
2 1/2 tsp (25g) salt
1 tbsp (10g) active dry yeast
3 1/2 c (800g) water

In a large bowl, mix together the flour, salt, and yeast. Slowly add the water while mixing with a rubber bench scraper. Continue to mix until the dough becomes elastic, 4-5 min. Transfer to a lightly floured suface and shape the dough into a ball, dusting with flour as needed. Place in a floured bowl and let it sit at room temp, covered, for 4hrs. Punch down the dough and scrap out onto a lightly floured surface. Shape the dough into a ball, dusting with flour as needed, and place in a heavily floured bowl. Cover and refrigerate for 12 hrs. Preheat oven to 500F with a baking stone on the middle rack. Gently transfer the dough to a heavily floured peel, reshaping it to make it round. Make 3 parallel slits across the dough, cutting 1/8" deep. Transfer the dough to the baking stone and bake until golden brown, 25-40 min. Let cool completely before slicing.
