1 lb ground beef

In a large bowl, combine ground beef, ground pork, Panko, egg yolks, allspice, nutmeg and cooked onion; season with salt and pepper, to taste. Using a wooden spoon or clean hands, stir until well combined. Roll the mixture into 1 1/4-1 1/2" meatballs, forming ~24 meatballs. Add remaining 1 tbsp olive oil to the skillet. Add meatballs, in batches, and cook until all sides are browned, ~4-5 min. Transfer to a paper towel-lined plate.
