Dark Chocolate Pudding

1 large egg + 2 yolks
6 oz (170g) bittersweet chocolate (66%-74%) chopped
2 tbsp (30g) unsalted butter, softened
1 tsp vanilla
2 1/2 c whole milk
1/2 c heavy cream
1/3 c brown sugar
2 tbsp (15g)  unsweetend cocoa powder
2 tbsp (20g) cornstarch
1/4 tsp fine sea salt

In a small heatproof bowl, whisk together egg and yolks. Set aside. Place chocoalte, butter, and vanilla in a food processor or blender. In a medium pot, whisk together milk, cream, sugar, cocoa, cornstarch, and salt until smooth. Bring to a full boil, whisking, and let bubble for 1-2 min to activate cornstarch. At that point, it will start to thicken, and when it does, immediately pull off heat. Pour a little of the hot mixture into the eggs, stirring constantly to prevent them from curdling, then pour eggs back into the pan. Cook over low heat, whisking constantly, until mixture just returns to a bare simmer (one bubble is plenty). Immediately pour into the food processor or blender with the chocolate. Run the machine until the pudding is very smooth. Pour into individual bowls or a large decorative bowl and cover with plastic wrap. Refrigerate until firm and cold, at least 4 hrs for individual servings and 8 hrs for single bowl. Can be made up to 3 days ahead.
