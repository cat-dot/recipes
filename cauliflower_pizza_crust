Cauliflower Pizza Crust
  -adapted from lucky penny blog

1 medium head of cauliflower (3 c processed)
1/4 tsp kosher salt
1/2 tsp dried basil (crush between fingers)
1/2 tsp dried oregano (crush between fingers)
1/2 tsp garlic powder
few shakes of crushed red pepper (optional)
2 tbsp almond meal
1 tbsp (or more) nutritional yeast (optional)
1 tbsp olive oil
1 egg
nonstick cooking spray

Place a pizza stone in the oven or baking sheet. Preheat oven to 450F. On a cutting board, place a large piece of parchment paper and spray with nonstick cooking spray (or brush with oil). Wash and thoroughly dry cauliflower. Cut off the florets, you don't need much stem. Pulse in food processor for ~30 s, until you get a powdery snow. You shuold get ~3 c of cauliflower snow. Place in a microwave safe bowl and cover. Nuke for 4 min. Dump cooked cauliflower onto a clean tea towel and allow to cool for a bit. Once cool enough to handle, wrap it up in the towel and wring the water out of it. You want to squeeze as much out as possible. Dump cauliflower into a bowl. Add all the spices, almond meal, nutritional yeast, and olive oil. Mix to incorporate all the ingredients. Now add the egg and mix again. Hands work best. Once everything is mixed well, form the dough into a crust on the prepared parchment paper. Pat it down thoroughly, you want it nice and tightly formed together. Using a cutting board, slide the parchment paper onto the hot pizza stone or baking sheet in the oven. Bake for 12-20 min, or until it starts to turn golden brown and the edges crisp up. Remove from oven.

Add toppings (recommend precooked to decrease additional cook time) and slide back into oven to cook for another 5 min or until cheese is gooey. Can also use the broiler to quickly melt cheese.
