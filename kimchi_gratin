Kimchi Gratin
  --Mandy Lee

4 1/3 c (850 g) loosely packed, lightly drained kimchi
8 oil-packed anchovies + 1 tbsp of their oil
1 1/4 tsp freshly ground black pepper
1 c (227 g) heavy cream
3/4 c (180 g) plain whole-milk yogurt
7 garlic cloves, grated
1/4 tsp freshly grated nutmeg + more for serving
3 c (320 g) Mexican-style shredded cheese blend, divided
1/4 c (48 g) chopped pickled jalapeños
1-2 tsp gochugaru, depending on your heat preference
5 fresh shiso leaves, or 3 scallions, or a handful of fennel fronds, thinly sliced (optional)
2 tsp toasted sesame oil

Heat the oven to 425F (200C fan) and position a rack in the middle-upper area. If using whole kimchi, remove the stem and cut into 1" long segments. Place the kimchi in a large bowl. If the kimchi tastes very sweet and not sour enough (typical with store-bought kimchi), you can add additional tang by mixing in 1 tbsp of distilled white vinegar. In a medium saucepan over medium heat, combine the anchovies and their oil and black pepper. Cook, pressing on the anchovies until broken down and slightly browned. Turn off the heat and mix in the heavy cream, yogurt, garlic, nutmeg, and 2 1/2 c of the cheese. Mix ~3/4 (~ a heaping 2 c) of the anchovy mixture into the kimchi until well combined, then transfer into a 2 1/2 - 3 qt ramekin or baking dish. Add the remaining 1/2 c of cheese and the chopped jalapeño to the remaining anchovy mixture in the medium saucepan until combined, then set aside. Bake the gratin for ~35 min, until bubbling. Switch the oven to broil on high. Remove the baking dish from the oven, then dollop the reserved cheese mixture over the top, sprinkle with the gochugaru, and grate a bit more nutmeg over the top. Scatter over the shiso leaves or scallions or fennel fronds (if using). Broil for 5 minutes, and once the cheese on top has melted, drizzle the toasted sesame oil over the surface and return to the broiler for 1 to 2 more minutes, until browned. Serve immediately.
