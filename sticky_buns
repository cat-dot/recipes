Easy Sticky Buns
  - Ina Garten

12 tbsp unsalted butter
1/3 c light brown sugar, lightly packed
1/2 c pecans roughly chopped
1 package (17.3oz/2 sheets) frozen puff pastry, defrosted

Filling:
2 tbsp unsalted butter, melted
2/3 c light brown sugar, lightly packed
3 tsp cinnamon
1 c raisins

Preheat oven to 400F. Place 12 c muffin tin on a sheet pan lined with parchment paper. In the bowl of an electric mixer fitted with the paddle attachement, combine butter and sugar. Place 1 rounded tbsp of the mixture in each of the muffin cups. Distribute the pecans evenly on top of butter mixture. Lightly flour a work surface. Unfold 1 sheet puff pastry with the folds going left to right. Brush the whole sheet with the melted butter. Leaving a 1" border, sprinkle each sheet with half the sugar, cinnamon, and raisins. Starting with the end nearest you, roll the pastry up snugly, finishing the roll with the seam side down. Trim the ends of the roll about 1/2" and discard. Slice the roll in 6 equal pieces, each ~1 1/2" wide. Place each piece, spiral side up, in muffin cups. Repeat with the second sheet of puff pastry. Bake for 30 min, until buns are golden to dark brown on top and firm to the touch. Allow to cool for 5 min, then invert the buns onto parchment paper, ease the filling and pecans out onto the buns with a spoon, and cool completely.
