  --My Fitness Pal

3 tbsp (44ml) safflower oil
2 tbsp black bean garlic sauce
3 medium garlic cloves, finely chopped
1 tbsp fresh ginger, finely chopped
1 tbsp low-sodium shoyu
3 c (390g) cold cooked brown rice
3 c (170g) shiitake mushrooms, caps sliced, stems discarded
2 celery stalks, thinly sliced
1 large carrot, finely diced
1 lb (454g) shrimp, peeled and deveined
3/4 c (127g) frozen peas
2 green onions, thinly sliced
1 large egg, beaten

Place a large, rimmed baking sheet in the center of the oven and preheat to 450F (246C). In a large bowl, whisk together the oil, black bean sauce, garlic, ginger and soy sauce. Crumble the rice into the bowl. Add the mushrooms, celery and carrots, and toss everything together. Pour the mixture onto the preheated baking sheet and spread evenly with a spatula. Bake until the rice begins to brown in the corners of the pan, 10 min. Add the shrimp and peas to the rice mixture and stir with a spatula to loosen any stuck-on bits. Arrange the mixture in an even layer in the center of the baking sheet without any of the baking sheet visible. Drizzle the egg over the rice mixture. Bake until the shrimp is cooked through and the egg is set, 8 min.
