Salsa Roja
  --Cook's Illustrated

1 dried ancho chile, stemmed, seeded, and torn into 1/2" pieces (1/4 c)
1 lb plum tomatoes, cored and halved, divided
1-3 tsp  minced canned chipotle chile in adobo sauce, divided
1/4 small onion, root end attached
1 jalapeno
1 large garlic clove, unpeeled
1/4 c fresh cilantro leaves and stems, chopped coarse
3/4 tsp salt

Process ancho pieces in blender until finely chopped, ~20 s. Add 1/4 tomatoes and 1 tsp chipotle. Process on low speed, scraping down sides of blender jar if necessary, until tomatoes are finely chopped and ancho pieces are moistened, ~45 s. Let mixture sit for 15 min. Meanwhile, line rimmed baking sheet with foil. Adjust oven rack 4" from broiler element and heat broiler. Place remaining tomatoes skin side down on prepared sheet. Add onion and jalapeno and broil until blackened and tomatoes are beginning to turn spotty brown, 4-6 min. Flip onion and jalapeno, add garlic, and broil until all vegetables are blackened, 3-4 min. Transfer jalapeno and garlic to cutting board; let cool. When cool enough to handle, peel garlic. Without peeling, stem and seed jalapeno. Add tomatoes, jalapeno, onion, garlic, cilantro, and salt to blender and process until smooth. Season with salt and add up to 2 tsp  additional chipotle to taste; process until smooth. Transfer to serving bowl or squeeze bottle. If desired, stir in water, 1 tsp at a time, to loosen to drizzling consistency. Leftover salsa may be refrigerated for up to 1 week.
