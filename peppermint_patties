Peppermint Patties

1/2 c shredded unsweetened coconut
1/3 c raw cashews, soaked*
1/3 c coconut oil, melted
3 tbsp maple syrup
1 1/2 tbsp coconut or almond milk
1 tsp peppermint extract
5 oz dark chocolate (vegan if desired)
1 tsp coconut oil

Place shredded coconut, soaked cashews, melted coconut oil, maple syrup, coconut milk and peppermint extract into a high speed blender or food processor. Blend until completely smooth, this can take 2-3 min. Transfer mint filling into a lidded bowl and refrigerate until hardened, ~1 hr. Line a baking sheet with parchment paper. Scoop out a 1/2 tbsp of chilled filling and place dome side up in your palm. With your other palm, slightly press down to form a patty. Set the patty on the lined baking sheet and continue until all of the filling has been used to form patties. Place baking sheet into the freezer. Melt chocolate and coconut oil; once chocolate is melted and smooth remove patties from freezer. Using a fork, one at a time drop a patty into the chocolate. Quickly flip the patty over, and lightly shake any excess chocolate off. Set dipped patty back onto baking sheet where it came from. Repeat with each patty until all have been coated in chocolate. Once all patties are coated, place the baking sheet into freezer one last time to harden and let the chocolate coating set, 10 min.
Store in the refrigerator or freezer until ready to devour. 

NOTES:
*To soak cashews, place them into a bowl and cover them with water. For best results soak overnight. If using a high speed blender or food processor you can attempt to use after a few hours, but I would encourage soaking overnight for optimum smoothness. It’s super important to be quick when dipping patties into chocolate. Otherwise the patty can break apart into the chocolate and it’s just bad news.
