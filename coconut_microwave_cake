Coconut Applesauce Microwave Keto Cake
  --Jessica Kellgren-Fozard

2 eggs
1/4 tsp baking powder
3 tbsp unsweetend applesauce
2 tbsp granulated sweetener
3 tbsp coconut flour

Mix all ingredients together in a microwave safe bowl. Microwave for 5 min (900W-20 s longer for lower power), check that the center is firm, if not, microwave for 30 s at a time until it is.

Can be served with yogurt and frozen berries for garnish.

Optional extras: sprinkle of cinnamon, drop of vanilla

Notes: if swapping out coconut flour for something else, will need to use more
       if using liquid sweetener, use a little less
       if using sweetened applesauce, cut out sweetener entirely
       can swap pureed pumpkin for applesauce
