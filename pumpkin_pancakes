Whole Wheat Pumpkin Pancakes

1 c milk
3/4 c canned pumpkin puree
2 tbsp unsalted butter, melted, + more for cooking
2 tbsp honey
1 large egg
1/2 c whole wheat flour
1/2 c ap flour
2 tsp baking powder
1/2 tsp fine sea salt
maple syrup for serving

Preheat oven to 200F. In a medium bowl, whisk together the milk, pumpkin, butter, honey, and egg. In a second medium bowl, whisk together the flours, baking powder, and salt. Add the pumpkin mixture and stir until just combined. Do not over mix, there will be lumps. Heat a large nonstick skillet or griddle over medium heat. Lightly brush with butter. Pour 2-3 tbsp of batter onto the skillet. Repeat once or twice to make more pancakes. Cook until the surface of the pancakes start to bubble, 1-2 min, then carefully flip and continue cooking until the bottom is lightly browned, 1-2 min. Keep warm in the oven while making the rest. Serve warm with maple syrup or toppings of your choice.
