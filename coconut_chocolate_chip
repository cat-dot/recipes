Chewy Coconut Chocolate Chip Cookies

1/2 c whole wheat flour
1 c quick cooking rolled oats
1 c unsweetend shredded coconut
1 tsp baking soda
1 tsp kosher salt
1 stick (4oz) unsalted butter at room temp
1/2 c packed light brown sugar
1/4 c granulated sugar
1 tsp vanilla
1 large egg at room temp + 1 egg yolk
1/2 c semisweet chocolate chips

In a medium bowl, whisk together the flour, oats, coconut, baking soda, and salt. In a stand mixer fitted with the paddle attachment, cream the butter, brown sugar, and granulated sugar on medium high speed until fluffy and yellow. Add the vanilla and eggs, one at a time, beating after each addition for 30 s. Reduce the speed to medium low and add the flour mixture in 3 parts, beating for ~10 s after each addition. Add the chocolate chips and mix until just combined. Cover the bowl with plastic wrap and refrigerate for at least 30 min or overnight. Preheat the oven to 350F. Line a rimmed baking sheet with parchment paper. Scoop out portions of dough the size of golf balls, roll them between your palms loosely, and place them 2" apart on the baking sheet. Bake for 14 min or until the cookies are set around the edges. Halfway through baking, remove the pan from the oven and drop it onto a heat safe flat surface. Immediately return the cookies to the oven, rotating the pan 180 degrees and complete baking until the center resists light pressure but is still somewhat soft.
