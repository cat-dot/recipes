Chocolatge Hazelnut Buckwheat Tart

Filling:
3/4 c heavy cream
3/4 c whole milk
1 12 tsp gelatin
1/2 tsp kosher salt
1 stick unsalted butter
1 1/2 c (8oz) milk chocolate

In a small saucepan, bring the cream, milk, gelatin, salt, and butter to a simmer over medium heat. Place the chocolate in a heatproof bowl and pour the cream mixture over the top. Stir until smooth, then chill in the refrigerator until set, 2hrs.

Crust:
1 1/3 c buckwheat flour
6 tbsp cornstarch
1/3 c sugar
1 stick unsalted butter, cubed and chilled
1 egg

Preheat the oven to 350F. In a food processor, combine all the ingredients and pulst until a crumbly dough comes together. Transfer to a clean surface and knead until a smooth dough forms. Transfer to a 9" tart pan and press the dough to fit the pan. Bake until set and puffed, 15 min. Let cool completely.

Praline:
1/2 c sugar
1 1/4 c hazelnuts, toasted and peeled

Line a baking sheet with parchment paper and set aside. In a small saucepan, add the sugar over high heat. Cook, stirring as needed, until an amber caramel forms, 2-3 min. Stir in the hazelnuts to coat, then spread the mixture out in an even layer on the prepared baking sheet. Let cool completely, then transfer to a blender. Blend, scraping as needed, until a paste forms.

Assemble:
Spread the praline in a smooth layer on the bottom of the tart. Spread the chocolate over the praline, swirling the top with an offset spatula. Garnish with flaky sea salt and serve.
