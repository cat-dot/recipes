Cast Iron Baked Pepperoni Pizza Dip
  --America's Test Kitchen

3 oz thinly sliced pepperoni, quartered
1 tbsp evoo
3 garlic cloves, minced
1 lb pizza dough
8 oz cream cheese, cut into 8 pieces and softened
3/4 c pizza sauce
4 oz mozzarella cheese, shredded (1 c)
2 tbsp chopped fresh basil

Adjust oven rack to middle position and heat oven to 400F. Cook pepperoni in 10" cast iron skillet over medium heat until crisp, 5-7 min. Using slotted spoon, transfer pepperoni to paper towel lined plate; set aside. Off heat, add oil and garlic to fat left in skillet and let sit until fragrant, ~1 min; transfer to medium bowl. Place dough on lightly floured workspace, pat into rough 8" square, and cut into 32 pieces (1/2 oz each). Working with 1 piece of dough at a time, roll into tight ball, then coat with garlic oil. Evenly space 18 balls around edge of skillet, keeping center of skillet clear. Place remaining 14 balls on top, staggering them between seams of balls underneath. Cover loosely with greased plastic wrap and let sit until slightly puffed, ~20 min. Remove plastic. Transfer skillet to oven and bake until balls are just beginning to brown, ~20 min, rotating skillet halfway through baking. Meanwhile, whisk cream cheese and pizza sauce together in large bowl until thoroughly combined and smooth. Stir in mozzarella and 3/4 of pepperoni. Spoon cheese mixture into center of skillet, return to oven, and bake until dip is heated through and rolls are golden brown, ~10 min. Sprinkle with basil and remaining pepperoni. Serve.
