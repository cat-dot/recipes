Pastrami Waffles

1 1/2 lb russet potatoes, peeled and finely shredded (~2 medium potatoes)
1 medium yellow onion, finely shredded
5 tsp kosher salt
3 large eggs
3/4 c olive oil
freshly ground black pepper to taste
1 c instant mashed potato mix
2 c diced pastrami

In a large colander, toss the shredded potatoes and onion with the salt and set over a smaller size bowl, leaving at least 1/2" of space between the bottom of the colander and the bowl, let sit for 20 min to drain. Meanwhile, in a large bowl, whisk together the eggs and olive oil with a pinch of black pepper. Add the drained potato onion mixture, instant mashed potato mix, and pastrami, folding to combine. The mixture should be thick and hold its shape, similar to an uncooked hash or latke. Makes 5 1/2 c.
When waffle iron is hot, add about 2 c of the batter, 1/2 c per square. Cook until the waffles are deep brown and crispy, 6-8 min. Transfer waffles to a wire rack and keep warm in oven.
