Preheat oven to 350F. In a medium skillet over medium heat, warm 2 tbsp oil. Add onion and jalapeno; sprinkle with a pinch of salt and cook for 2-3 min or until the onions are translucent and slightly golden. Add garlic and cook just until fragrant. Toss in cashews and continue to cook for 1 min to warm them through. Remove from heat. Transfer to a blender. Add water, nutritional yeast, spices, and 2 tsp salt. Blend until very smooth. Toss the sauce well with pasta and pour into a greased casserole dish. In a small bowl, mix bread crumbs with oil, parsley, pepper flakes, and salt to taste. Sprinkle the bread crumb mixture over the top of the pasta. Bake for 15 min or until golden brown.
