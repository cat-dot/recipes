Brothy Pasta with Chickpeas (pasta e cici)
  --Andy Baraghani and Chris Morocco

3 tbsp evoo + more for drizzling
1 small onion, finely chopped
kosher salt
3 garlic cloves, thinly sliced
1 sprig rosemary
1/4 tsp crushed red pepper flakes (more or less to taste)
15 oz can chickpeas, rinsed and drained
1 c whole peeled tomatoes, crushed by hand
6 oz orecchiette or other short pasta
2 tbsp finely chopped parsley
3 tbsp finely grated parmesan + more for serving
freshly ground black pepper

Heat oil in large saucepan over medium. Add onion and season with salt. Cook, stirring occasionally, until onion is beginning to soften, ~5 min. Add garlic and continue to cook, stirring occasionally, until onion and garlic are both very soft and just beginning to brown around the edges, 5-6 min. Add rosemary and red pepper flakes and cook, stirring, until fragrant, ~30 s. Add chickpeas and tomatoes and cook, stirring occasionally, until tomatoes are slightly thickened, 6-8 min. Add pasta and 4 c water. Increase heat to medium high, bring to a simmer, and cook, stirring occasionally to prevent pasta from sticking, until pasta is al dente, 13-16 min depending on shape. Stir in parsley and parmesan; season with salt. Serve with drizzle of oil, black pepper, and more parmesan as desired.


Notes: Suggestions for boosting flavor, add tomato paste, can use basil instead of parsley, maybe add better than boullion to water,
