Chapati

2 1/4 c durum wheat flour, divided
1/2 tsp fine sea salt
3 tbsp olive oil, + more for brushing
3/4 c lukewarm water, divided + more as needed
flaky sea salt to finish

In a large bowl stir together 2 c of flour and the salt until combined. Slowly add the oil and 1/2 c of the water, simultaneously stirring with your fingertips in a circular motion. Continue to add enough water until the dough comes together, then transfer to a kitchen surface and knead until soft and supple, 10 min. Cover with a damp kitchen towl and let rest 20 min. Roll and shape the dough into a 2" log. Pinch off 12 golf ball size pieces and roll each piece in between your palms to form a smooth ball; cover with the kitchen towel. Place the remaining flour in a small bowl. Working with 3 pieces at a time, flatten each ball slightly and dunk in the flour bowl. Using a rolling pin, roll each ball into a 6" wide circle. Heat a large skikllet over medium high heat. Slap the rolled chapati between your hands, then slap it onto the hot skillet, and cook until small bubbles form, 20-30 sec. Use a pair of tongs to flip the chapati, then brush with a little oil. Let cook until small to medium bubbles form and the bottom is golden brown, another 30-40 sec. Flip and brush with a little more oil over the surface, then press down on the puffed chapati edges with a dry kitchen towl, gently pushing the air to puff up the center. Cook until puffed and both sides are oiled and browned, 1 min. Transfer to a towel-lined plate and sprinkle with flaky sea salt.
