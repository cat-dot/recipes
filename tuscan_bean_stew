  --Cook's Illustrated

1 lb dried cannellini beans (~2 c) rinsed and picked over
1 tbsp evoo + extra for drizzling
6 oz pancetta cut into 1/4" pieces
1 large onion, chopped medium (~1 1/2 c)
2 medium celery ribs, cut into 1/2" pieces (~3/4 c)
2 medium carrots, peeled and cut into 1/2" pieces (1 c)
8 medium garlic cloves, peeled and crushed
4 c low sodium chicken broth
3 c water
2 bay leaves
1 bunch kale or collard greens (~1 lb) stems trimmed and leaves chopped into 1" pieces (~8 c loosely packed)
14.5 oz can diced tomatoes, drained and rinsed
1 sprig fresh rosemary
ground black pepper
salt

Dissolve 3 tbsp salt in 4 qt cold water in large bowl or container. Add beans and soak at room temp for at least 8 hrs and up to 24 hrs. Drain and rinse well. Adjust oven rack to lower middle position and heat oven to 250F. Heat oil and pnacetta in large dutch oven over medium heat. Cook, stirring occasionally, until pancetta is lightly browned and fat has rendered, 6-10 min. Add onion, celery, and carrots. Cook, stirring occasionally, until vegetables are softened and lightly browned, 10-16 min. Stir in garlic and cook until fragrant, ~1 min. Stir in broth, water, bay leaves, and soaked beans. Increase heat to high and bring to simmer. Cover pot, transfer to oven, and cook until beans are almost tender, 45-60 min. Remove pot from oven and stir in greens and tomatoes. Cover pot, return to oven, and continue to cook until beans and greens are fully tender, 30-40 min longer. Remove pot from oven and submerge rosemary sprig in stew. Cover and let stand 15 min. Discard bay leaves and rosemary sprig and season stew with salt and pepper to taste. If desired, use back of spoon to press some beans against side of pot to thicken stew. Serve over toasted bread, if desired, and drizzle with evoo.
