  --America's Test Kitchen
  
3 lb chuck eye roast, cut into 1 1/2" cubes
1 1/2 tsp salt
1 tsp ground black pepper
3 tbsp vegetable oil
2 medium onions, chopped coarse (~2 c)
3 medium cloves garlic, minced
3 tbsp unbleached ap flour
1 c red wine (full bodied)
2 c low sodium chicken broth
2 bay leaves
1 tsp dried thyme
6 small boiling potatoes, peeled and halved
4 large carrots, peeled and sliced 1/4" thick
1 c frozen peas (6 oz) thawed
1/4 c minced fresh parsley leaves

Heat oven to 300F. Place beef cubes in large bowl. Sprinkle with salt and pepper; toss to coat. Heat 2 tbsp of the oil over medium high heat in large nonreactive soup kettle; add beef to kettle in 2 separate batches. Brown meat on all sides, ~5 min per batch, adding remaining tbsp of oil if needed. Remove meat and set aside. Add onions, saute until almost softened, 4-5 min. Reduce heat to medium and add garlic; continue to saute ~30 s longer. Stir in flour; cook until lightly colored, 1-2 min. Add wine, scraping up any fond. Add stock, bay leaves, and thyme; bring to simmer. Add meat; return to simmer. Cover and place in oven; simmer ~1 hr. Remove from oven, add potatoes and carrots, cover, and return to oven. Simmer until meat is just tender, ~1 hr. Remove stew from oven. (Can be cooled, covered and refrigerated for up to 3 days.) Add peas and allow to stand 5 min. Stir in parsley, adjust seasoning, and serve.
