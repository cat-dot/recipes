Fermented Garlic
  --Pete & Pam Robbins

Variant #1
1 c water
1 tbsp salt
1 tsp oregano
1 tsp peppercorns
garlic cloves



Variant #2
1/2-3/4 c apple cider vinegar
1 tbsp salt
1/2 tsp dill
1/2 tsp crushed red pepper
1/2 tsp coriander seed
1/2 tsp cardamon pod
1/2 tsp mustard seed
1/2 tsp peppercorn
garlic cloves

Mix all ingredients except garlic cloves until well combined. Place garlic in glass jar and pour liquid over so that all all garlic is submerged. For #1, leave on counter away from sunlight for a week prior to putting in refrigerator. For both variants, min time to leave alone is 2 weeks, the longer the better the taste.
