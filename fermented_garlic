Fermented Garlic
  --Pete & Pam Robbins

Variant #1
1 c water
1 tbsp salt
1 tsp oregano
1 tsp peppercorns
garlic cloves



Variant #2
1/2-3/4 c apple cider vinegar
1 tbsp salt
1/2 tsp dill
1/2 tsp crushed red pepper
1/2 tsp coriander seed
1/2 tsp cardamon pod
1/2 tsp mustard seed
1/2 tsp peppercorn
garlic cloves


On both, iirc place all ingredients in non-reactive airtight container, with the lid loose, in a cool, dark place for a few days (maybe 7?). Probably wise to leave air gap and have something underneath to catch any overflow. Then tighten lid and place in refrigerator for min 2 weeks and enjoy. The longer in the fridge, the better.
