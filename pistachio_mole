Pistachio Mole

¼ cup evoo
1 red onion, thinly sliced
3 lbs tomatillos
2 serrano chiles, stemmed
4 garlic cloves
1 tbsp ground cinnamon
2 tsp whole cumin seeds, toasted
2 whole cloves
3 c chicken stock (preferably homemade)
1½ c shelled unsalted pistachios, roasted
1 c packed cilantro leaves
Salt, to taste

In a large mixing bowl, combine the evoo, red onion, tomatillos, chiles and garlic and toss, making sure everything is evenly coated with oil. Transfer to an aluminum-lined sheet tray and place on the middle rack under a broiler, gently stirring occasionally, until all the vegetables are deeply charred but not burnt, 25-30 min. Remove the sheet tray from the oven and transfer the vegetables to a medium saucepan placed over medium-high heat. Add the cinnamon, cumin, cloves and stock. Bring to a simmer and cook, stirring occasionally, until the vegetables are tender, about 10 min. Add the pistachios and cilantro and cook for an additional 10 min. Working in batches, purée the mixture in a blender on high speed until smooth. Season with salt; cool, then refrigerate or freeze until needed.
