Vietnamese Mayonnaise

2 egg yolks
1/2 tsp kosher salt
1/2 tsp dijon mustard
1 tbsp fresh lemon juice
2 tsp unseasoned rice wine vinegar
1 c canola oil

In a food processor, combine the yolks, salt, mustard, lemon juice, and vinegar. Pulse a few times to incorporate. With the processor running, slowly dizzle in the oil until the mixture begins to emulsify. Cover and chill until ready to use.
