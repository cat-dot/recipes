Strawberry Matcha Mochi Waffles
  --@FoodWithLiz, GIR

1/2 c freeze dried strawberries, blended into a powder 
2 tsp matcha powder
1 c Mochiko (sweet rice flour)
3/4 c milk
1/4 c avocado oil
1 tbsp baking powder
2 tbsp sugar
2 tsp vanilla extract
1/4 tsp salt
fresh strawberries

In a large mixing bowl, combine rice flour, baking powder, sugar and salt. Add in milk, oil, and vanilla extract and stir until just combined—don’t overstir! Transfer half of the mochi batter from the mixing bowl into a separate smaller bowl. In one bowl, mix in the freeze dried strawberry powder, and in the other one mix in the matcha. In a waffle maker, spoon half strawberry batter and half matcha batter into the waffle press and let cook until golden and crispy (~5 min each waffle for me). Repeat with remaining batter. Top with fresh strawberries, mint to garnish, and maple syrup. Enjoy!
