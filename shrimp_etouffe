  --Imma

2 tbsp (28 ml) canola oil
2 tbsp (28 g) butter
1/4 c (31 g) flour
1/2 medium onion, diced
1/2 c green bell pepper, diced
1/2 c celery, chopped (~1-2 stalks)
2 tsp (10 g) garlic, minced
1 tsp (1 g) thyme, fresh or dried
1 bay leaf
1 c tomato, chopped
1 tsp (5 g) Worcestershire sauce
1/2 tsp (1 g) smoked paprika
2 tsp (8 g) Creole seasoning
2 c (500 ml) seafood broth (can sub with water)
1 lb (453 g) shrimp, (peeled and deveined) reserve shrimp shells
1 tsp (5 g) hot sauce, optional
2 green onions, chopped
2-3 tbsp (8-12 g) parsley, chopped

Stock:
Add a tsp or two of butter or oil to a saucepan or skillet. Then throw in shrimp shells, the remaining scraps of onion, garlic, celery together with aromatics like bay leaf and thyme. Sauté for ~5-7 min, constantly stirring to prevent burning. Add ~5 c of water to it. Remove from heat and strain using a sieve. Set stock aside.

Etouffee:
In a large Dutch oven or heavy-bottomed saucepan, combine melted butter, oil, and flour until smooth. Cook on medium heat, stirring continuously, for ~10-12 min, or until you have achieved the desired color. During this process, don't walk away from the stove because it might burn. Add the onion, green pepper, and celery, and cook for 8-10 min – stirring frequently. Then add garlic, thyme, and bay leaf – continue stirring ~2 min longer. 
Next, throw in ~1 c chopped tomatoes, Worcestershire sauce, paprika, and Creole seasoning, and let it cook for 5 min. Gradually pour in ~2 c of shrimp stock, bring to a boil, and let it simmer. Add the shrimp and simmer for 5 more min. Or you may season the shrimp with Creole seasoning, sauté for ~5 min, and then throw it in at the last minute. You've got two options here – both work. Adjust the soup's thickness and flavor with more shrimp broth or water, hot sauce, and salt. Stir in the green onions and chopped parsley. Serve over hot cooked rice.



Creole seasoning:
3 tbsp onion powder
3 tbsp garlic powder
1 1/2 tbsp black pepper
1 1/2 tbsp white pepper
6 tbsp paprika
1/2 - 1 tbsp cayenne pepper (adjust to suit taste buds)
1 1/2 tbsp oregano
1 tbsp dried parsley
1 1/2 tbsp dried thyme
1 1/2 tbsp dried basil

Combine all the ingredients in a bowl, or Jar and stir so that all the ingredients have been fully combined. Store in airtight container.
