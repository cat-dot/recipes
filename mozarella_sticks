  --Cook's Country

1 lb whole milk mozzarella cheese
1/2 c ap flour
2 large eggs
2 c panko bread crumbs
1/2 tsp salt
1/2 tsp pepper
1/4 tsp dried oregano
1/4 tsp garlic powder
2 qt peanut or vegetable oil
1 c marniara sauce, warmed

Set wire rack in rimmed baking sheet and line half of rack with triple layer of paper towels. Slice mozzarella crosswise into 6x1/2" wide planks. cut each plank lengthwise into 3 equal sticks, ~18 pieces. Spread flour in shallow dish. Beat eggs in second shallow dish. Pulse panko, salt, pepper, oregano, and garlic powder in food processor until finely ground, ~10 pulses; transfer to third shallow dish. Working with 1 piece at a time, coat sticks with flour, shaking to remove excess; dip in eggs, allowing excess to drop off; and dredge in panko mixture, pressing to adhere. Transfer to plate. Freeze sticks until firm, at least 1 hr or up to 2 hrs. Add oil to large dutch oven until measures ~1 1/2" deep and heat over medium high heat to 400F. Add 6 sticks to hot oil and fry until deeply brown on all sides, ~1 min. Adjust burner as necessary to maintain oil temp between 375-400F. Transfer sticks to paper towel side of prepared rack to drain for 30 s, then move to unlined side of rack. Return oil to 400F and repeat frying in 2 more batches. Serve with marinara.


Notes: Do not use fresh or part-skim mozzarella, their high moisture content can cause the sticks to rupture in the hot oil.
