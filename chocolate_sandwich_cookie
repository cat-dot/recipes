Cookies:
2 1/2 c ap flour
1/2 c unsweetened cocoa powder
1 stick + 5 tbsp unsalted butter, softened
2/3 c sugar
3/4 tsp fine sea salt
1 large egg white
1 tsp vanilla

Preheat oven to 350F and line 2 baking sheets with parchment paper. In a medium bowl, whisk together the flour and cocoa powder until incorporated. In the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with the paddle attachement, cream the butter with the sugar and salt until light and fluffy. Add the egg white to the bowl and mix until smooth, then add vanilla and continue mixing. Add the flour mixture and mix until a dough holds together. Transfer to a clean work surface and knead until smooth. Divide the dough in half and for each portion into a disk. Working with 1 disk at a time, roll between 2 sheets of parchment paper to a thickness of 1/8". Transfer to the freezer for 1 hr. Working with 1 sheet at a time, peel back the parchment and using a 2" round or fluted cutter, cut out 24 cookies from each sheet and place on the prepared baking sheets. Bake 12-14 min, rotating the trays, until firm to the touch. Let cool completely.

Filling:
6 tbsp unsalted butter, softened
1 1/4 c confectioners' sugar
2 tsp vanilla
1/4 tsp fine sea salt

In the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with the paddle attachment, beat all of the ingredients together until light and fluffy, 3-4 min. Spread 1/2 tbsp of the filling on 1 cookie and sandwich with another. Repeat with remaining cookies. Chill cookies for 1 hr until the filling is firm.
