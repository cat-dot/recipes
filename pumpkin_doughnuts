Pumpkin Doughnuts  - gf

Doughnuts:
3 tbsp butter
½ c granulated sugar
1 c pumpkin purée
3 eggs
2 tsp baking soda
1 tsp pumpkin pie spice
1½ c brown rice flour
1 c almond flour

Preheat oven to 350F. Cream together the butter and sugar for 1 min on medium to high speed. Add in the pumpkin purée and mix for another 30 s. Scrape down the bowl. Add in the eggs, one by one, and mix on medium speed for 30 s. In a separate bowl, mix together the baking soda, pumpkin pie spice and flours. Add the dry ingredients to the wet and mix together for 1 min. Spray your doughnut pan with nonstick cooking spray. Fill a piping bag with your doughnut batter and pipe the batter into your doughnut pan. Bake for 12-13 min. Remove the doughnuts from the oven and let cool on a cooling rack.

Glaze:
4 tbsp butter
½ c maple syrup
1⅓ c confectioners’ sugar

In a sauté pan over medium heat, melt the butter and whisk in the maple syrup. Once the butter has melted, remove from the heat and whisk in the confectioners’ sugar.

Dip each doughnut face down into the glaze (do a double dip if you’re feeling adventurous). Let dry on parchment paper, then serve.
