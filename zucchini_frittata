  --Cook's Country

10 large eggs
1/2 c half-and-half
1 1/4 tsp salt, divided
1/4 tsp pepper
4 tbsp unsalted butter, divided
1 lb cherry tomatoes, halved
3 tbsp thinly sliced shallot, divided
2 tbsp chopped fresh basil, divided
1 tsp seasoned rice vinegar
2 zucchini, shredded
3 oz goat cheese, crumbled (3/4 c)

Adjust oven rack to upper-middle position and heat oven to 375F. Whisk eggs, half-and-half, 1 tsp salt, and pepper together in bowl; set aside. Melt 1 tbsp butter in 12" ovensafe nonstick skillet over medium-high heat. Add tomatoes, 1 tbsp shallot, and remaining 1/4 tsp salt. Cook until tomatoes release their juice and just begin to break down, ~5 min. Transfer tomatoes to bowl and stir in 1 tbsp basil and vinegar; set aside. Add zucchini, remaining 3 tbsp butter, and remaining 2 tbsp shallot to now-empty skillet. Cook over medium heat until zucchini has softened, ~7 min. Stir in egg mixture and sprinkle evenly with goat cheese and remaining 1 tbsp basil. Transfer skillet to oven and bake until frittata is just set in center, ~12 min. Let rest for 5 min. Slide frittata onto platter, cut into wedges, and serve with tomato sauce
