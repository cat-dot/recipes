Gari (pickled ginger for sushi)

8 oz ginger
1/2 c sugar
1 c rice vinegar
1 tsp salt

Peel ginger using a vegetable peeler. Use a mandoline to slice thin, then place in a jar. In a small saucepan, heat sugar, vinegar, and salt until boiling, then reduce the heat and simmer until sugar dissolves. Pour the warm pickling liquid over the ginger, let it cool, then place the lid on the jar and let it sit in the refrigerator overnight. The longer it sits, the sweeter it will be.

Notes:
Look for young ginger with pink tips. If not available, cook peeled ginger in boiling water for 5 min, then drain and shock with cold water. Repeat if needed until slices are tender. The smoother the skin, the younger the ginger.
