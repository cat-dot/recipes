Shredded Root Vegetable Pancakes

2 c shredded rutabaga, parsnips, or sweet potato (~2 medium vegetables) shredded on the medium holes of a box grater
1 medium yellow onion, grated on the medium holes of a box grater
3 large egg whites, beaten
1/4 c ap flour + more if needed
1 tsp kosher salt
freshly cracked black pepper
1/2 c coconut or grapeseed oil
1/4 c sour cream or creme fraiche
2 scallions finely chopped

Place the grated vegetables and onion in a large kitchen towel and wring out any liquid, then add to a medium bowl. Stir in the egg whites. Stir in the flour, salt, and pepper to taste. In a large skillet, heat oil over medium high heat. Use a scant 1/4 c measure to scoop pancakes into the skillet, using the bottom of the measuring cup to spread the mixture into 1/2" thick patties. Cook until the first side is deeply golden brown and crisp, 3-4 min, then flip and brown the other side, 3-4 min more. Transfer to a wire rack to cool slightly. Work in batches, adding more oil as needed. Serve with a few pinches of flaky sea salt, a dollup of creme, and a sprinkle of scallions.
