Poached Branzino with Beurre Blanc

1/4 large (4 oz) english cucumber - peeled, seeded, and finely grated on a microplane
1 tbsp rice wine vinegar
1 tbsp grapeseed oil
kosher salt and freshly ground pepper to taste
1 lb (2 each) branzino fillets
3 tbsp dry white wine
2 tbsp pernod
4 tbsp unsalted butter, cubed + more for greasing
2 tbsp olive oil
1 tbsp white soy sauce + more to taste
3/4 tbsp yuzu juice
red mustard green leaves for garnish

Preheat oven to 350F. Place the grated cucumber in cheesecloth and squeeze out all the liquid. Transfer the cucumber to a small bowl and stir in the vinegar and grapeseed oil. Season with salt and pepper, set aside. In a greased ovenproof 10" skillet, place the fillets side by side and cover with white wine and pernod. Season with salt and place in the oven. Bake until the fish is opaque and cooke through, 4-5 min. Remove from the oven and transfer the fillets to warm plates. Place the skillet with the poaching liquid on the stovetop over medium high heat and simmer until reduced by half, 1-2 min. Whisk in the butter and olive oil to emulsify. Stir in the soy sauce and yuzu, adding more soy to taste. Divide the cucumber between the plates of fish, then garnish each with a red mustard green leaf. Spoon the sauce over top, then serve.
