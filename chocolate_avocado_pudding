Dark Chocolate Avocado Pudding   gf,dairy-free
  --America's Test Kitchen

1 c water
1/4 c (1 3/4 oz) sugar
1/4 c (3/4 oz) unsweetened cocoa powder
1 tbsp vanilla
1 tsp instant espresso powder (optional)
1/4 tsp salt
2 large ripe avocados (8 oz each) halved and pitted
3 1/2 oz 70% dark chocolate, chopped

Combine water, sugar, cocoa, vanilla, espresso (if using), and salt in small saucepan. Bring to simmer over medium heat and cook, stirring occasionally, until sugar and cocoa dissolve, ~2 min. Remove saucepan from heat and cover to keep warm. Scoop flesh of avocados into food processor bowl and process until smooth, ~2 min, scraping down sides of bowl as needed. With processor running, slowly add warm cocoa mixture in a steady stream until completely incorporated and mixture is smooth and glossy, ~2 min. Microwave chocolate in bowl at 50% power, stirring occasionally, until melted, 2-4 min. Add to avocado mixture and process until well incorporated, ~1 min. Transfer to bowl, cover, and refrigerate until chilled and set, at least 2 hrs or up to 24 hrs. Serve.


Notes: this is dairy free so long as you pay attention to the ingredients of the 70% dark chocolate (Ghiradelli tends to have milk product in theirs)
