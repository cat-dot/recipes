Jerk Baby Back Ribs

¼ c molasses
2 tbsp dark brown sugar
2 tbsp ground allspice, preferably Jamaican
2 tbsp dark rum
1 tbsp lime juice
1 tbsp kosher salt
1 tsp ground cinnamon
1 tsp ground nutmeg
4 garlic cloves, smashed
4 to 5 Scotch bonnet peppers, stemmed
2 scallions, trimmed and roughly chopped
6 lbs (2 racks) baby back ribs

In a blender, purée all the ingredients, except for the ribs, until smooth. Place the ribs in a large bowl and pour the marinade over them. Using gloves, rub the marinade on the ribs. Cover the bowl with plastic wrap and refrigerate overnight. The next day, preheat oven to 325F and line a sheet pan with foil and a baking rack. Place both racks of ribs on the prepared sheet pan and cover with foil. Roast until tender, 2-2 1/2 hrs. Remove the foil and let cool completely. Transfer all the pan drippings to a small saucepan over medium heat. Bring to a simmer and cook until reduced by half, 10-12 min. Then let cool. Brush half of the mixture over the cooled racks of ribs. Prepare a medium-hot fire in a charcoal grill or heat a gas grill to medium heat. Grill the ribs, flipping often, basting them with the remaining marinade until lightly charred and warmed through, 8-12 min; then serve.
