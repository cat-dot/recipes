Whole Wheat English Muffins

2 tsp (7g) active dry yeast (1 packet)
4 tbsp (60g) unsalted butter
1/2 c plain yogurt
1/2 c warm whole milk
1/2 tbsp honey
1 tsp (5g) fine sea salt
1 c (125g) whole wheat flour
1 c (125g) ap flour
1/2 tsp (4g) baking soda
Cornmeal, preferably coarse, as needed

In a small bowl combine yeast and 1/3 c warm water and let rest until yeast has dissolved, ~5min. Melt 2 tbsp butter and put in a large bowl. Whisk in yogurt, milk, honey, salt, and the yeast mixture. Add flours and baking soda to bowl and beat thoroughly with a spoon or rubber spatula until well combined. Cover bowl and let rest in a warm spot for 1 - 1 1/2hrs, or until dough has doubled. Preheat oven to 250F. Lightly dust a baking sheet with cornmeal. Place a large skillet over medium heat and melt 1 tbsp butter. Using a large ice cream scoop or 1/2 c measuring cup, drop batter into skillet to form round muffins about 4" in diameter, mounding the batter in the center. (You may need to coax the dough a little with your fingers and they don't need to be perfectly circular) Repeat until you have 3 muffins, leaving the rest of the batter for a second batch. Reduce the heat to low. Cover the skillet with lid and cook 3-5 min, until bottoms are golden brown. Uncover skillet and flip muffins using a spatula. Cover again and cook 2-4 min until the other sides are golden brown. Place muffins on prepared baking sheet. Repeat using another tbsp of butter. Bake muffins for 7-10 min, or until puffed and cooked through. Split the muffins with a fork and toast before eating.
