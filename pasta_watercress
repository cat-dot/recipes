Creamy Peppadew Pasta with Watercress and Pine Nuts

300g (~10.5oz) pasta (farfalle, etc)
1 clove garlic, peeled
~7 pieces hot peppadew piquante peppers
few sprigs of fresh parsley
1/2 tbsp fresh lemon juice
2 tbsp cream cheese
1 tbsp greek yogurt
salt
black pepper
handful fresh watercress
3 tbsp pine nuts

Boil the pasta until cooked al dente. Meanwhile, add the garlic to a mini food processor with the peppers and parsley. Blitz until roughly chopped. Add lemon juice, cream cheese, yogurt, and a generous amount of salt and pepper. Blitz again to produce a fairly smooth sauce. When the pasta is cooked, drain it and add the sauce, watercress, and pine nuts. Mix well to combine. Place over low heat for a minute or two, stirring constantly, to heat through, then serve.
