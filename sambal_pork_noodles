Spicy Sweet Sambal Pork Noodles
  --Chris Morocco
  
2 tbsp evo
2 lb ground pork, divided
2" piece fresh ginger, peeled, cut into thin matchsticks or finely chopped
8 garlic cloves, thinly sliced
2 tbsp sugar
2 tbsp tomato paste
2 sprigs basil + more for serving
1/3 c hot chili paste (ex. sambal oelek)
1/4 c shoyu
1/4 c unsweetened rice vinegar
1 1/2 lb fresh ramen noodles or 16 oz dried spaghetti
kosher salt
2 tbsp unsalted butter

Heat oil in a large wide heavy pot over medium-high. Add half of pork to pot, breaking apart into 6–8 large chunks with a wooden spoon. Cook, undisturbed, until well browned underneath, ~5 min. Turn pieces and continue to cook, turning occasionally, until pork is browned on 2–3 sides, ~5 min longer. Add ginger, garlic, sugar, and remaining pork to pot and cook, breaking up pork into small clumps, until meat is nearly cooked through, ~5 min longer. Add tomato paste and 2 basil sprigs. Cook, stirring occasionally, until paste darkens, ~2 min. Add chili paste, shoyu, vinegar, and 2 c water. Bring to a simmer, reduce heat to low, and cook, uncovered and stirring occasionally, until sauce is slightly thickened and flavors have melded, 30-45 min. Cook noodles in a large pot of boiling salted water, stirring occasionally, until 1 min short of al dente. Add noodles to sauce along with butter and a splash of cooking water. Simmer, tossing occasionally, until sauce begins to cling to noodles, ~1 min. Pluck out basil sprigs. Serve, topping with torn basil.
