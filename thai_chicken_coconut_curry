Thai Chicken Coconut Curry
  --Averie Sunshine

2-3 tbsp coconut oil (olive oil may be substituted)
1 medium/large sweet Vidalia or yellow onion, diced small
1 lb boneless skinless chicken breast, diced into bite-sized pieces
3 cloves garlic, finely minced or pressed
2-3 tsp ground ginger or 1 tbsp fresh ginger, finely chopped
2 tsp ground coriander
13 oz can coconut milk (I used lite; full-fat will deliver a richer/thicker result)
1-1 1/2 c shredded carrots
1-3 tbsp Thai red curry paste, or to taste (curry powder may be substituted, to taste)
1 tsp kosher salt, or to taste
1/2 tsp freshly ground black pepper, or to taste
~3 c fresh spinach leaves
1 tbsp lime juice
1-2 tbsp brown sugar, optional and to taste
1/4 c fresh cilantro, finely chopped for garnishing (basil may be substituted)
rice, quinoa, or naan, optional for serving

To a large skillet, add the oil, onion, and saut√© over medium-high heat until the onion begins to soften ~5 min; stir intermittently. Add the chicken and cook for about 5 minutes, or until chicken is done; flip and stir often to ensure even cooking. Add the garlic, ginger, coriander, and cook for ~1 min, or until fragrant; stir frequently. Add the coconut milk, carrots, Thai curry paste, salt, pepper, and stir to combine. Reduce the heat to medium, and allow mixture to gently boil for ~5 min, or until liquid volume has reduced as much as desired and thickens slightly. Add the spinach, lime juice, and stir to combine. Cook until spinach has wilted and is tender, ~1-2 min. Taste and optionally add brown sugar, additional curry paste, salt, pepper, etc. to taste. Evenly sprinkle with the cilantro and serve immediately. Curry is best warm and fresh but will keep airtight in the fridge for up to 1 week.


Notes: can sub fish sauce for the salt
