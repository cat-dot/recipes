Southern-Style Biscuits

10 tbsp unsalted butter, frozen
2 c ap flour
1 tbsp baking powder
1 tsp sugar
1/4 tsp baking soda
1 tsp kosher salt
3/4 c chilled buttermilk
1/4 c chilled heavy cream

Place rack in the center of oven and preheat to 450F. Grate the frozen butter using the large side ofa box grater. Transfer to a bowl and place in the freezer to chill.
Sift the flour, baking powder, sugar, and baking soda into a large bowl. Whisk in the salt. Using a fork, stir in the grated butter then make a well in the center. Add the buttermilk and cream, and stir until the dough begins to clump and become shaggy. Turn the dough onto a lightly floured surface. Working quickly, gently press and fold the dough 4-5 times (try not to knead or squeeze the dough_, then form it into a rectangle. Pat the dough down to a uniform thickness of 3/4". Using a 2 /12" cutter, press straight down through the dough, without twisting.Gather and pat down scraps if needed. Place biscuits on a parchment-lined bajung sheet so that they are just touching and chill in the fridge for 20 min. Bake until golden on top, 12-15 min. 

Dough can be made ahead, cut into biscuits, frozen on a sheet tray and stored in a freezer bag for up to a month.
