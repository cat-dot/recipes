Kale Pesto
  --Bon Appetit Test Kitchen

1 medium bunch kale, center ribs and stems removed
kosher salt
1 garlic clove, crushed
1/4 c finely grated parmesan (1 oz)
1/4 c walnuts, toasted
1/2 c olive oil
1 tbsp (or more) fresh lemon juice
freshly ground black pepper

Blanch kale in a large pot of boiling salted water, ~1 min. Drain and rinse with cold water to cool; wring dry. Transfer to food processor, add garlic, cheese, and nuts, and pulse until coarsely chopped. With motor running, add oil in steady stream and process to a coarse puree. Add lemon juice and season with salt and pepper.


Notes: Can sub pistachios (or pinenuts) for walnuts.  Can use blender (vitamix) instead of food processor, blending everything but kale first, then adding kale. Stir in up to 1/2 c pasta water if using with pasta.
