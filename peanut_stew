African Chicken Peanut Stew

2-3 lbs chicken legs, thighs, and/or wings
3 tbsp oil
1 sliced large yellow or white onion
3" piece of peeled & minced ginger
6-8 roughly chopped garlic cloves
2-3 lbs sweet potatoes, peeled and cut into chunks
1x15oz can of crushed tomatoes
1 quart chicken stock
1 c peanut butter
1 c roasted peanuts
1 tbsp ground coriander
1 tsp cayenne
salt & pepper
1/4-1/2 c chopped cilantro

Heat oil in a large soup pot set over medium-high heat. Salt the chicken pieces well, pat them dry, and brown them in the oil. Don't crowd the pot; do this in batches. Set them aside as they brown. Saute the onions in the oil for 3-4 min, stirring often and scraping away browned bits off the bottom of the pot. Add the ginger and garlic and saute another 1-2 min, then add the sweet potatoes and stir well to combine, cooke for another 5 min. Add the chicken, chicken broth, crushed tomatoes, peanut butter, peanuts, coriander, and cayenne, and stir well to combine. Bring to a simmer and taste for salt, adding more if needed. Cover the pot and simmer gently for 90 min (check after an hour). or until the chicken meat easily falls off the bone and the sweet potatoes are tender. Remove the chicken pieces and set them in a bowl to cool, until cool enough to touch. Remove the meat from the bones (toss or chop the skin, it's personal pref) and put the shredded meat back in the pot. Adjust the seasonings for salt and cayenne, then add as much black pepper as you think you can stand - the stew should be peppery. Stir in the cilantro and server.
