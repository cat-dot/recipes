Position rack in the center of the oven and preheat to 350F. Place the almonds on a foil-lined baking sheet and bake until golded brown, 8-10 min. Set aside.
Increase the oven to 450F. Place 2 tbsp butter into a 10" cast iron skillet and place in the oven until the butter is melted and the skillet is very hot, 2-3min. 
In a blender, mix together the eggs, milk, flour, sugar, vanilla, 1/2 of the cinnamon, salt, and nutmeg until smooth. Carefully pour the batter into the preheated skillet and place it in the oven. Bake until the edges of the pancake are golden brown and have puffed up, 12-15min. Meanwhile, in a medium skillet over medium heat, melt the remaining butter. When the butter begins to foam, add the pears, brown sugar, and remaining cinnamon, and cook until the pears are caramelized and just tender, 4-6 min.
Gently nestle the caramelized pears into the dutch baby. Top with toasted almonds and confectioners' sugar, and serve with lemon wedges.
