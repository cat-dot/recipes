Macaroni & Cheese

3/4 lb elbow macaroni
3 tbsp unsalted buter + more for buttering the pan
1/4 c flour
3 c whole milk, warmed
fine sea salt
freshly ground black pepper
12 oz grated sharp cheddar cheese ( 4 1/2 c)
1/3 c panko bread crumbs


Heat oven to 350F. Butter a 2 quart casserole. Cook the pasta in a large pot of salted water to very al dente; drain. Meanwhile, melt butter in a medium saucepan over medium heat. Stir in the flour, mixing constantly, until golden and no longer raw smelling, 2-3 min. Stir in the warm milk, a little at a time. Bring to a simmer and cook, stirring and scraping the bottom of the saucepan constantly, until it thickens enough to coat the back of a wooden spoon, 5-10 min. (This is a white sauce, or bechamel) Season with 1/2 tsp salt and 1/4 tsp black pepper. Remove from heat and stir in 3/4 of the cheese until melted. Fold in the cooked macaroni. Taste and season again as needed. Transfer to the casserole. Top with remaining cheese and breadcrumbs. Bake until brown and bubbly, 30-35 min.

ways to make it tastier:

Add 1 tsp dry mustard and 1/4 tsp hot sauce to the bechamel.

Add a boquet garni( bay leaf, some whole peppercorns, thyme sprigs, and parsley stems) to the milk as you heat it, then let it simmer with the bechamel as it cooks. Remove before adding cheese.

Substitute brioche bread crumbs. Cut brioche into cubes and dry them out over night. Pulse in a food processor until crumbly.

Substitute other cheeses. Ex. blue and gruyere, taleggio and humbolt fog, taleggio and parmesan

Fold seared bacon, pancetta, or guanciale into pasta before baking
