Orange Pound Cake
  --Dorothy Kern

Cake:
3 c ap four
1 tsp baking powder
1 tsp salt
1 c unsalted butter
2 c sugar
5 large eggs 
3/4 c buttermilk
1/3 c oj
2 tbsp orange zest
1 tsp vanilla
1/2 tsp orange extract (optional)

Preheat oven to 350F; spray bundt pan with nonstick spray (preferrably one with flour). Whisk together flour, salt, and baking powder in a medium bowl. With an electric mixer, cream butter and sugar until light and fluffy. Add eggs, one at a time, beating well after each addition. Combine buttermilk with orange zest, orange juice, vanilla extract and orange extract (if using) in a measuring cup. Add the flour mixture (with the mixer on low) in three parts alternately with the buttermilk mixture, beginning and ending with flour. Beat just until it comes together. Do not overmix! Pour batter into prepared pan. Bake until a toothpick inserted in centers comes out clean, 45-55 min.

Glaze:
1/4 c sugar
1/4 c oj

Heat sugar and orange juice in a small pan over low heat. Bring to a simmer and stir. Once sugar is dissolved, remove from heat and let sit until cake is done. It will thicken as it cools.
Once done, cool cake 10 minutes in pan, then turn out cake onto a rack. Use a pastry brush to spread the glaze evenly over the tops and sides of the cake. Let dry and cool completely before drizzling with frosting.

Frosting:
1 c powdered sugar
1-2 tbsp oj
1 tbsp orange zest

Whisk powdered sugar with juice and zest. Use 1-2 tbsp of oj for desired consistency. Leave the cake on a rack. Drizzle over cake and let dry, ~30 min. Carefully transfer cake to a serving plate.

Store loosely covered for up to 3 days


Notes: You can also bake this in two 8.5x4-inch or two 9x5" loaf pans. Baking time will be between 35-50 min.
The original recipe for this cake used 1/2 c unsalted butter and 1/2 c plain greek yogurt. You can still make it that way (the rest of the recipe is the same) but it will change the texture of the cake.
