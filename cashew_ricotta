Cashew Ricotta

1/2 c cashews
1 c water
juice of 1 lemon
1 tbsp nutritional yeast

Soak cashews in the water for 2hrs (or even overnight). Drain and place in a blender or food processor. Add lemon juice and yeast. Blend everything until it's thick and textural, then season with salt and pepper to taste.


tips:1. if you add more water and process longer, can make cashew cream
     2. can flavor however you like: chile flakes, garlic, fresh herbs
     3. more like marscapone with a few dates and a dash of vanilla
