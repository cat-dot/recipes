Cashew Ricotta

1/2 c cashews
1 c water
juice of 1 lemon
1 tbsp nutritional yeast

Soak cashews in the water for 2hrs (or even overnight). Drain and place in a blender or food processor. Add lemon juice and yeast. Blend everything until it's thick and textural, then season with salt and pepper to taste.


tips:1. if you add more water and process longer, can make cashew cream
     2. can flavor however you like: chile flakes, garlic, fresh herbs
     3. more like marscapone with a few dates and a dash of vanilla

Makes ~2 c 

1 1/2 c raw cashews (210 f, 7.5 oz)
1 tbsp apple cider vinegar
1 tbsp nutritional yeast
1 tsp white miso
1 garlic clove 
1/4 tsp onion powder
1/2 tsp salt
6 tbsp unsweetened oat milk

Soak the cashews in one of the following three ways: 
1.The night before you want to make the cashew ricotta, cover the cashews with water and let them stand overnight. 
2. An hour before you want to make the cashew ricotta, cover the cashews with boiling water and let stand for 1 hr. 
3. Right before you want to make the cashew ricotta, cover the cashews with water in the Instant Pot and cook under high pressure for 3 min, followed by natural pressure release. This makes for the plumpest, softest, creamiest cashews. 

Drain the soaking liquid from the cashews and place them in a food processor along with the rest of the ingredients. Process until smooth and creamy. Refrigerate until chilled.
