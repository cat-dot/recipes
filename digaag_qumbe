Blend tomatoes, jalapenos, and bell pepper in a blender or food processor until almost smooth; set aside. Heat oil in a large pot over medium. Add onion and garlic and cook, stirring often, until beginning to soften, ~5 min. Add ginger, cumin, curry powder, tumeric, and cardamom; season generously with salt. Cook, stirring, until very fragrant, ~1 min. Add tomato mixture to pot and stir well to combine. Stir in yogurt and tomato paste, cover pot, and simmer 10 min. Add potato and carrot and continue to cook, stirring occasionally, until vegetables are nearly tender, 15-18 min. Add chicken, coconut milk, ghee (if using) and cilantro. Stir to combine, then simmer until chicken is tender and sauce thickens, ~20 min. Season with salt. Serve with rice or spinach, top with cilantro leaves.
