In a small glass steep the saffron threads with the hot water and set aside. Melt the butter in a medium saucepan over medium-high heat. Add the onion and sauté until translucent, ~5 min. Add the spices and sauté until fragrant and the onions are soft, ~5 min. Add the rice and sauté and stir until well coated and the rice is infused with spices. Add the saffron “tea”, lemon zest and the remaining water.  Taste and adjust seasoning with salt and pepper.  Add the chopped fruit and stir to combine.  Cover saucepan with a tight fitting lid and turn heat down to medium-low and cook until rice is tender, 13-15 min. Turn off heat and keep covered to steam for an additional 10 min.  Remove lid and fluff rice with a fork.  Taste and adjust season with salt and pepper. Transfer rice to a serving platter and garnish top with chopped nuts, herbs and pomegranate seeds. Serve rice family style.
