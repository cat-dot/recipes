Bread:
3 1/4 c (16 1/4 oz) ap flour
1/4 c (1 3/4 oz) sugar
1 tbsp instant or rapid rise yeast
1 1/2 tsp red pepper flakes
1 1/4 tsp salt
1/2 c warm water
2 large eggs + 1 yolk
4 tbsp unsalted butter, melted
6 oz monterey jack cheese, cut into 1/2" cubes (1 1/2 c), room temp
6 oz provolone cheese, cut into 1/2" cubes (1 1/2 c), room temp

Whisk flour, sugar, yeast, pepper flakes, and salt together in a bowl of stand mixer fitted with dough hook. Whisk warm water, eggs, yolk, and butter together in liquid measuring cup. Add egg mixture to flour mixture. Knead on medium speed until dough clears bottom and sides of bowl, ~8 min. Transfer dough to unfloured workspace, shape into ball, and transfer to greased bowl. Cover with plastic and let rise in warm place until doubled in size, 1 1/2-2hrs. Grease 9" round cake pan. Transfer dough to unfloured workspace and press to deflate. Roll dough into 18x12" rectangle with long side parallel to edge. Distribute cheeses evenly over dough, leaving 1" border around edges. Starting with closest edge, roll dough into log. Pinch seam and ends to seal, then rol log so seam side is down. Roll log back and forth, applying gentle, even pressure, until log reaches 30" in length. If any tears occur, pinch to seal. Starting at one end, wind log into coil; tuck end underneath coil. Place loaf in prepared pan and cover loosely with clean dish towel. Let rise in warm place until doubled in size, 1-1 1/2 hrs. Adjust oven rack to lower middle position and heat oven to 350F. 

Topping:
1 large egg, lightly beaten
1 tsp red pepper flakes
1 tbsp unsalted butter, softened

Brush top of loaf with egg, then sprinkle with pepper flakes. Place pan on rimmed baking sheet. Bake until loaf is golden brown, ~25 min. Rotate loaf, tent with foil, and continue to bake until loaf registers 190F, 25-30 min longer. Transfer pan to wire rack and brush with butter. Let cool for 10 min. Run knife around edge of pan to loosen bread. Slide bread onto wire rack and let cool for 30 min before slicing. Serve warm.
