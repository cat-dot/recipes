Pumpkin Flan

1 3/4 c (350g) granulated sugar, divided
1 cinnamon stick
2 c (473ml) half and half
4 large eggs + 2 large egg yolks
1 tsp vinlla
1/2 tsp pumpkin pie spice*
1/8 tsp fine salt
1/2 c (125g) pumpkin puree
1/2 c (125g) butternut squash puree

In a heavy saucepan, mix 3/4 c sugar and 1/4 c water. The mixture should look like wet sand. Cook over medium heat, stirring frequently, until it begins to make large bubbles. Continue to cook without stirring, rotating the pan regluarly, until the caramel is translucent and amber-colored, 12-15 min. Working quickly, pour caramel into a 2 quart oven safe glass bolw and rotate the bowl so it coats the sides. In another saucepan, combine the remaining sugar, cinnamon stick, and half and half. Cook over medium heat, stirring occasionally, until sugar is dissolved, 5 min. Let cool. Heat oven to 350F. Whisk eggs and yolks in a large bowl until well blended. Whisk in vanilla, spices, salt, pumpkin and squash puress. Add cooled cream mixture and whisk well. Pour custard mixture through a mesh sieve, stirring and pressing with a spatula, into the bowl with the caramel. Place the bowl with the custard into a large baking dish and carefully add warm water until it reaches halfway up the sides of the flan bowl. Cover with foil and bake for 30 min. Remove foil and bake for another 45-60 min or until flan is just set in the middle, but still jiggles slightly. A wider, shallower baking vessel will cook more quickly than a deeper one. Remove flan from water bath and let cool to room temp. Refrigerate until complete cool, preferably overnight. To serve, run a knife around the edges of the flan, put a serving platter on top of the bowl and invert.

* pumpkin pie spice = 1/4 tsp cinnamon, 1/8 tsp ginger, 1/8 tsp nutmeg, and a pinch each of allspice and cloves.
