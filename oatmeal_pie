Black Bottom Oatmeal Pie

Crust:
1 1/4 c (155g) ap flour
1 1/2 tsp (6g) granulated sugar
1/2 tsp (3g) salt
1 stick (4oz or 115g) cold unsalted butter cut into chunks
1/4 c (60ml) very cold water + anadditional tbsp  if needed

In the bottom of a large bowl, combine the flour, salt, and sugar. Work the butter into the flour with your fingertips or a pastry blender until mixture resembles a coarse meal and the largest bits are the size of tiny peas. Add 1/4 c cold water and stir with a spoon or flexible silicone spatula until large clumps form. Use your hands to kneads the dough together right in the bottom of the bowl. Add extra water if necessary. Wrap dough in a sheet of plastic wrap and refrigerate for at least 1 hr or up to 48 hrs, or you can quick firm this in the freezer for 15 min. Longer than 2 days, it's best to freeze it until needed. On a floured surface, roll the dough out into a 12-13" circle-ish shape. Fold dogh gently in quarters without creasing and transfer to a 9" standard pie pan. Unfold dough and trim overhand to about 1/2". Fold overhang under edge of pie crust and crimp decoratively. If not parbaking, place in fridge until ready to fill. If parbaking, place in freezer for 20 min until solid. (optional) Heat oven to 400F. Line frozen crust with lightly buttered or oiled foil. Fill with pie weights. Bake on rimmed baking sheet for 20 min. Carefully remove weights & foil and let cool completely before filling

Filling:
1 1/2 c (120g) rolled oats
1/4 c (60ml) heavy cream
4 oz (115g) bittersweet chocolate, coarsely chopped
3/4 c (145g) packed light brown sugar
1/4 tsp ground ginger
1/2 tsp kosher salt
5 tbsp (70g) unsalted butter, melted
1 c dark corn syrup
1 tsp vanilla extract
2 tsp apple cider vinegar
4 large eggs

Spread oats on a rimmed baking sheet and toast in the oven for 10-12min, stirring occasionally. Set aside to cool. Reduce the oven temp to 325F. Bring the cream just to a boil over medium heat in a small saucepan. Pour in chocolate pieces and whisk until melted and smooth. Scrape the chocolate into the bottom of the cooled pie shell and spread evenly. Place in the freezer while making the filling. In a large bowl whisk together the brown sugar, ginger, slat, and melted butter. Add the corn syrup, vanilla, and cider vinegar and whisk to combine. Add the eggs one at a time, whisking well after each addition. Stir in the cooled oats. Place chocolate-coated pie shell on a rimmed baking sheet and pour filling over. Bake for 55-70 min, rotating 180 degrees for even color if needed halfway. The pie is done when the edges are set and puffed slightly and the center is slightly firm to the touch but still has a little give - like gelatin. Allow to cool completely on a wire rack, 2-3 hrs.
