Pumpkin Soup
  --Grace Elkus

2 tbsp olive oil
1 medium yellow onion, very finely chopped
3 cloves garlic, grated
15 oz can pumpkin purée (~2 c)
2 tbsp fresh thyme leaves + more for serving
3/4 tsp kosher salt
1/2 tsp ground cumin
1/4 tsp freshly ground black pepper
1/8 tsp ground ginger
1/8 tsp cayenne pepper
2 c low-sodium vegetable broth
2 tbsp maple syrup
2 tbsp heavy cream
Toasted pumpkin seeds and flaky sea salt, for serving (optional)

Heat the olive oil in a medium saucepan over medium heat until shimmering. Add the onion and garlic and cook until fragrant, 3-4 min. Add the pumpkin purée, thyme, salt, cumin, black pepper, ginger, and cayenne pepper. Cook over medium-low until steaming and fragrant, ~5 min. Add the vegetable broth and cook for 3-4 minutes, stirring constantly. (The mixture will bubble.) Remove from heat and stir in the maple syrup and heavy cream. (At this point, for a creamier soup, you can use an immersion blender or transfer to a blender to purée until it reaches your desired consistency.) Serve warm, garnished with the pumpkin seeds, flaky salt, fresh thyme leaves, and more black pepper.
