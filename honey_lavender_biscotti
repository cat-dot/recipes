Honey Lavender Biscotti
  --Cook's Illustrated

2 1/4 c unbleached ap flour
1/2 tsp baking soda
1 tsp baking powder
1/4 tsp salt
2/3 c sugar
3 large eggs
3 tbsp honey
1 large orange; zested and minced to yield 2 tbsp zest
1 tbsp dried lavender blossoms (optional)

Whisk sugar and eggs in large bowl to a light lemon color; stir in next 3 (or 4) ingredients. Sift dry ingredients over egg mixture, then fold in until dough is just combined. Adjust oven rack to middle position and heat oven to 350F. Halve dough and turn each portion onto an oiled baking sheet covered with parchment. Using floured hands, quickly stretch each portion of dough into a rough 13x2" log, placing them ~3" apart on the sheet. Pat each dough shape to smooth it. Bake, turning pan once, until halves are golden and just beginning to crack on top, ~35 min. Cool the loaves for 10 min; lower the oven to 325F. cut each loaf diagonally into 3/8" slices with a serrated knife. Lay the slices ~1/2" apart on the sheet, cut side up, and return to the oven. Bake, turning over each cookie halfway through baking, until crisp and golden brown on both sides, ~15 min. Transfer to wire rack and cool completely. Biscotti can be stored in airtight container for at least 1 month.



Notes: Works best with an assertive honey. Can skip lavender if hard to find.
