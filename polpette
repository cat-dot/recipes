Polpette (Barbacco's meatballs)

2 eggs
1 c milk
1 c panko breadcrumbs
2 lb ground pork
2 garlic cloves, grated on a microplane
2 tsp dry oregano
2 tsp chili flakes
1 bunch italian parsley, chopped
1 c grated parmesan cheese
1/2 c pine nuts, lightly toasted and coarsely chopped
1 c golden raisins
1 tbsp kosher salt
2 tsp ground black pepper
olive oil for cooking
tomato sauce

Preheat oven to 350F. Whisk eggs and milk together in a large bowl. Add breadcrumbs and let sit for 10 min. Add ground pork and remaining ingredients to the bowl, and mix thoroughly. Heat some olive oil in a saute pan over medium heat. Form a 1oz meat patty and fry until cooked through. Taste the meat and adjust seasoning if necessary. Roll out the rest of the meat into 2 1/2 oz meatballs (makes about 12). Place on a paper lined sheet pan. Brown meatballs in olive oil over medium heat (they should still be raw in the center). Work in batches and don't crowd the pan. Place the meatballs in a single layer in a baking dish, and cover halfway with heated tomato sauce. Bake until done, about 25 min. Serve over sauteed greens, soft polenta, or pasta.
