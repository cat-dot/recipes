Cilantro Rice
  --Eric Kim

1 tbsp unsalted butter
1 tbsp vegetable oil
1 tbsp onion powder
1 bunch cilantro, stems and leaves separated, both finely chopped
1 c long-grain white rice, such as jasmine or basmati
1/2 tsp kosher salt (Diamond Crystal) + more to taste
1 large jalapeño, thinly sliced
juice of 1/2 lime + more to taste

Melt the butter in a medium saucepan over medium heat. Add the oil, then stir in the onion powder and cilantro stems until fragrant, ~30 s. Add the rice and stir until oil-slicked, just a few seconds. Add 1 1/2 c water, raise the heat to high and bring to a simmer. Reduce the heat to low, cover the saucepan and cook until all of the water is absorbed, 17-20 min. Remove from the heat and let the rice sit, covered, to steam for 10 more min. Fold in the salt, cilantro leaves, jalapeño and lime juice. Taste for seasoning, adding more salt and lime juice as desired.


Notes:  replaces 1/3rd of the water (for the rice) with yoghurt, conferring a nice tang. can add garlic to saute step
