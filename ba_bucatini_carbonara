BA's Best Bucatini Carbonara

1/4 lb guanciale or pancetta, cut into 1/3" cubes
7 large yolks
1 large egg
1 lb bucatini
1/2 c finely grated pecorino or parmesan (can do mix of both) + more for garnish
2 tsp freshly ground black pepper (or 3/4 tsp green pepper + 3/4 tsp pink pepper + 1/2 tsp white pepper all freshly ground)
salt to taste

Cook guanciale in a large skillet over medium low heat, stirring frequently, until fat renders but guanciale is not browned, ~5 min. Pour into fine mesh sieve over a small bowl; reserve drippings. Transfer guaciale to a large bowl and let cool slightly. Add egg and yolks to bowl; whisk to blend, but do not add air. Cook pasta in heavily salted boiling water to package directions. Drain, reserving 1/2 c of the pasta water. Add pasta to bowl with egg mixture and immediately start tossing to combine. Add a little bit of the drippings, toss, add a little cheese, toss, add a little pasta water to loosen. Continue adding cheese and tossing, loosening up with pasta water as needed. Season with pepper and salt to taste. Serve, garnish with pecorino or parmesan.


Notes: can use any pasta really and sub bacon if you can't find guanciale or pancetta.
