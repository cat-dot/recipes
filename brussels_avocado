Roasted Brussel Sprouts with Avocado

Dressing:
1 tbsp lime juice
1 tbsp lemon juice
1 tbsp champagne vinegar
1 tbsp olive oil
1 tsp dijon mustard
1/2 tsp honey
1/2 tsp tabasco
1/2 tsp kosher salt
1/4 tsp whole grain mustard

In a small bowl, whisk all of the ingredients together and set aside.

Sprouts:
2 c medium sized brussels sprouts, trimmed
1/4 c olive oil
1 tbsp kosher salt
freshly ground black pepper to taste

Preheat oven to 400F. Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil and prepare an ice bath. Blanch the sprouts for 2 min in the pot, then transfer to the ice bath to cool. Once cooled, dry them well with paper towels and cut into half. In a large ovenproof skillet, heat oil over high heat. Add the sprouts to the pan and season with salt and pepper. Cook, tossing often, until lightly golden, 2-3 min. Place the skillet in the oven and roast until tender, 6-8 min. 

Assembly:
1 tbsp olive oil
1/2 c basil leaves
1/4 c mint leaves
2 tbsp sunflower seeds
1/2 mutsu apple, peeled, cored, and cut into 1/2" pieces
1/2 avocado, cut into 1/2" pieces
thinly sliced red finger chile, for garnish
lime zest, for garnish
flaky sea sat for garnish

Spoon the sprouts onto a platter and return the skillet to medium high heat. Add the oil to the pan, followed by the basil and mint. Fry the herbs until crisp, 10-15 s, then add the seeds and apple. Cook stirring constantly, until the seeds are toasted and the apples are warmed through, 1-2 min. Remove from heat. Drizzle the sprouts with the dressing, then spoon the apple mixture over top. Scatter the dish with the avocado. Garnish with chiles, zest, and salt, then serve.
