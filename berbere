Marcus Samuelsson's version

2 tsp coriander seeds
1 tsp fenugreek seeds
1/2 tsp black peppercorns
6 cardamom pods
4 garlic cloves
3 allspice berries
1/2 c dried onion flakes
5 chiles de arbol, stemmed and seeded
3 tbsp paprika
2 tsp kosher salt
1/2 tsp cinnamon
1/2 tsp ground ginger
1/2 tsp grated nutmeg

In a small skillet, combine the coriander, fenugreek, black peppercorns, cardamom, garlic, and allspice over medium heat. Swirling the skillet, toast until fragrant, 4 min. Remove from the heat and allow to fully cook, then place in a spice grinder or mortar and pestle with the dried onion flakes and chiles de arbol, and grind to a fine powder. Transfer the powder to a bowl and whisk in the remaining ingredients until fully incorporated. Use immediately or store in an airtight container in a cool, dark place for up to 6 months.
