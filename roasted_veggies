Shishito and Macadamia Romesco with Roasted Vegetables

Romesco:
3/4 c olive oil
3 large garlic cloves, smashed
1 c shishito peppers, stems removed (~12-14 peppers)
1/2 c macadamia nuts
1/2 c stale bread crumbs
1 medium yellow tomato, stemmed and chopped
2 tbsp sherry vinegar
1/2 c packed cliantro leaves
1 tsp kosher salt + more to taste
freshly ground black pepper

Heat the olive oil in a small saucepan over medium high heat. When the oil is hot, add the garlic, shishitos, and macadamia nuts, frying for 1 min. Add the bread and cook another 1-2 min. Add the tomato and sherry vinegar, reduce the heat to low and simmer for 10 min, stirring occasionally. Remove from the heat, stir in the salt and let cool to room temp, 20-30 min. In a blender, combine the cooled shishito mixture and the cilantro, and mix on medium speed until it becomes a chunky puree. Taste and adjust the seasoning with salt and pepper. Makes 1 1/4 c romesco. The sauce can be made and stored in the fridge for up to 3 days.

Veggies:
1/2 lb carrots halved
1/2 lb small turnips, cut into 1/2" wedges
10-15 tuscan kale leaves
1 tbsp olive oil
1/2 tsp kosher salt + more to taste

Preheat oven to 500F. Line a rimmed sheet pan with parchment paper. In a large bowl, season the carrots, turnips, and kale with the olive oil and salt. Toss evenly to coat and spread onto the prepared sheet pan. Roast until the kale leaves are crispy and charred, 4-5 min. Remove the kale and set aside. Return the sheet pan to the oven and roast until the carrots are charred and the turnips are blistered, another 4-5 min.

Spoon the sauce onto a large platter, place the roasted veggies on top and serve
