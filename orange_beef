Crispy Orange Beef
  --Cook's Illustrated

1 1/2 lbs beef flap meat, trimmed
3 tbsp shoyu
6 tbsp cornstarch
10 3" strips orange peel, sliced thing lengthwise (1/4 c) 
1/4 c oj (2 oranges)
3 tbsp molasses
2 tbsp dry sherry
1 tbsp rice vinegar
1 1/2 tsp toasted sesame oil
3 c vegetable oil
1 jalapeno, stemmed, seeded, and sliced thing lengthwise
3 garlic cloves, minced
2 tbsp grated fresh ginger
1/2 tsp red pepper flakes
2 scallions, sliced thin on bias

Cut beef along grain into 2 1/2-3" wide lengths. Slice each piece against grain into 1/2" thick slices. Cut each slice lengthwise into 1/2" wide strips. Toss beef with 1 tbsp shoyu in bowl. Add cornstarch and toss until evenly coated. Spread beef in single layer on wire rack set in rimmed baking sheet; place in freezer until meat is very firm, but not completely frozen, ~45 min. Whisk remaining 2 tbsp shoyu, oj, molasses, sherry, vinegar, and sesame oil together in bowl. Line second rimmed baking sheet with triple layer of paper towels. Heat vegetable oil in large dutch oven over medium heat until oil registers 375F. Carefully add 1/3 of beef and fry, stirring occasionally to keep beef from sticking together, until golden brown, ~1 1/2 min. Using spider, transfer meat to paper towel lined sheet. Return oil to 375F and repeat 2 more times. After frying, reserve 2 tbsp frying oil. Heat reserved oil in 12" skillet over medium high heat until shimmering. Add orange peel and jalapeno and cook, stirring occasionally, until about half the peel is golden brown, 1 1/2-2 min. Add garlic, ginger, and pepper flakes; cook, stirring frequently, until garlic is beginning to brown, ~45 s. Add shoyu mixture and cook, scraping up any browned bits, until slightly thickened, ~45 s. Add beef and scallions and toss. Transfer to platter and serve immediately.


Notes: to mimic tangerine, leave pith on orange peel. Do not use low sodium shoyu.
