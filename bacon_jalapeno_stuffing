Bacon and Jalapeno Stuffing

1 lb potato bread, torn into 3/4" pieces (10 c)
1 medium red oinion, quartered
1 large leek, halved lengthwise, then widthwise
1 tbsp olive oil
8 oz smoked bacon, medium dice
2 celery stalks, rougly diced (1 1/2 c)
1 large clove garlic, thinly sliced
1 1/2 c low sodium chicken stock
2 jalapenos, seeded and finely diced
1/2 c packed fresh parsley leaves finely chopped
1/2 c heavy cream
1 tsp kosher salt + more to taste
1 tbsp apple cider vinegar
zest of 1/2 lemon

Preheat the oven to 300F. Line the torn bread in a single layer on a parchment lined sheet tray and bake until completely dry, 20-25 min. Can be dried and stored covered up to 5 days in advance. Heat a large cast iron skillet over high heat until smoking 5-8 min. Add the red onion and leek, cut side down, and immediately drizzle the olive oil over top. Reduced the heat to medium high and cook, flipping occasionally, until all sides are charred, 10-15 min. Remove from the heat and when cool enough to handle, medium dice the onion and leeks. Return the skillet to medium high heat and add the bacon, rendering until lightly browned, 8-10 min. Add the celery and sweat until tender, 6-8 min, then add the garlic and cook until aromatic, 2 min more. Lower the heat to medium and add the charred onion and leek, sauteing until tender throughout, 3-5 min. In as small saucepan, bring the chicken stock to a boil over medium high heat, 5 min. While the chicken stock is heating, add the dried bread, jalapeno, parsely, and sage to the bacon leek mixture, and mix with a pair of large tongs to combine. Season with salt and drizzle the cream over the mixture, continuing to mix until everything is incorporated. Slowly add the hot chicken stock while simultaneously mixing the stuffing. Add the cider vinegar and lemon zest and season to taste.
