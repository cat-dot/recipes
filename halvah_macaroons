Halvah Macaroons
  --Lior Lev Sercarz

1 1/2 c unsweetened shredded coconut
2 tbsp tahini
1/3 c halvah, tightly packed
2 tbsp sugar
2 1/2 tsp la boite yemen spice (can sub 1 1/4 tsp each cinnamon and ginger)
1 1/2 tsp amchoor (sub cardamom)
2 egg whites, beaten to soft peaks
1/8 tsp salt
confectioners' sugar for dusting (optional)

Preheat oven to 350F. Line a sheet with parchment paper. In a mixing bowl, combine the coconut, tahini, halvah, sugar, yemen spice, and amchoor. Gently fold in the egg whites. Scoop the batter by the tablespoon and place the mounds on the lined cookie sheet. Bake for 11-12 min, until turning slightly golden, and allow to cool completely before serving.


Notes: looks like the yemen spice is a mix of cinnamon, ginger, and allspice and la boite is a brand
