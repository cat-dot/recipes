  --Alison Roman
  
6 finely grated garlic cloves
4 tsp finely grated peeled ginger
4 tsp ground tumeric
2 tsp garam masala
2 tsp ground coriander
2 tsp ground cumin
1 1/2 c whole milk yogurt (not greek)
1 tbsp kosher salt
2 lb skinless, boneless chicken breasts, halved lengthwise
3 tbsp ghee or vegetable oil
1 thinly sliced small onion
1/4 c tomato paste
6 cardamom pods, crushed
2 dried chiles de arbol (or 1/2 tsp crushed red pepper flakes)
28 oz can whole peeled tomatoes
2 c heavy cream
3/4 c chopped cilantro + sprigs for garnish

Combine garlic, ginger, tumeric, garam masala, coriander, and cumin in a small bowl. Whisk yogurt, salt, and half of spice mixture in a medium bowl; add chicken and turn to coat. Cover and chill 4-6 hr. Cover and chill remaining spice mixture. Heat ghee in a large heavy pot over medium heat. Add onion, tomato paste, cardamom, and chiles and cook, stirring often, until tomato paste has darkened and onion is soft, ~5 min. Add remaining spice mixture and cook, stirring often, until bottom of pot begins to brown, ~4 min. Add tomatoes with juices, crushing them with your hands as you add them. Bring to a boil, reduce heat, and simmer, stirring often and scraping up fond from bottom, until sauce thickens, 8-10 min. Add cream and chopped cilantro. Simmer, stirring occasionally, until sauce thickens, 30-40 min. Meanwhile, preheat broiler. Line a rimmed baking sheet with foil and set a wire rack inside sheet. Arrange chicken on rack in a single layer. Broil until chicken starts to blacken in spots, it will not be cooked through, ~10 min. Cut chicken into bite size pieces, add to sauce, and simmer, stirring occasionally, until chicken is cooked through, 8-10 min. Serve with rice and garnish with cilantro. Can be made 2 days ahead. 


Notes: double the spice and halve th ecream, adjust peppers to desired heat level. Use stick blender on sauce before adding chicken.
