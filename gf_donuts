  --Michelle2s
  
1 qt oil for frying
5 tbsp coconut milk
1/4 c gf ap flour
1 egg
2 tbsp almond flour
2 tbsp coconut flour
2 tsp honey
1/4 tsp guar gum
1 tbsp baking powder 

Heat oil in deep fryer or large pot to 300F (150C). Beat the rest of the ingredients together in a bowl using a hand blender until batter resembles a thick pancake batter. Drop by rounded spoonfuls into oil, working in batches, until donuts are dark brown, 3-5 min. Remove from oil and drain. 

Toppings: confectioners' sugar, sugar and cinnamon, etc.

Notes: Any nut flour can be subbed for almond flour; can use agave instead of honey; xantham for guar; may want to add sugar, up the honey content of the dough. Makes ~15, they don't keep so eat right away.
