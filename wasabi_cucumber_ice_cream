Wasabi Cucumber Ice Cream
  --Green Evi

1 can of full fat coconut milk
2–3 tbsp sugar of your choice (I used raw cane sugar)
1 cucumber
1/2 lime, juice
1 tsp moringa (optional)
1–2 tbsp wasabi paste

Cut cucumber into smaller pieces and add to a blender with coconut milk, sugar, lime juice, wasabi paste and moringa, and blend until smooth. If you have an ice cream maker, simply transfer to that and prepare according to manufacturer instructions. If you don’t have an ice cream maker, transfer mixture to a freezer safe container and place in the freezer. Whisk mixture with a fork (or use a handheld blender for a creamier version) every hour to incorporate air. Repeat until mostly firm, for ~6-8 hr. Take out ice from the freezer to soften for 10 min before serving. Enjoy!
