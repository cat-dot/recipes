Udon:
1 lb udon noodles
1 c (99 g) sliced baby trumpet mushrooms 
1/2 sweet onion, sliced into 3/4" thick juliliened segments
1 c rough chopped napa cabbage
3 green onions, cut into 1" segments
1/2 lb (330 g) ground pork

white pepper to taste 
pinch of aji no moto
3 cloves garlic, finely chopped
3 tbsp (42g) duck fat 
chili oil for topping *optional*
bonito flakes for topping
toasted sesame seeds for topping
thin cut green onion on a bias for topping

Bring pot of salted water to a boil, place udon in and cook for ~30 s. Drain, run under cold water, and cool completely. Set aside. Heat wok and lightly coat with oil. Cook pork, breaking up after achieving some caramelization. Remove from the wok. Add duck fat (or oil) to wok, then cook mushrooms and onions until soft, add cabbage and continue to stir fry, adding in the green onions. Add the pork, toss to combine, then add the noodles, salt, white pepper, and aji no moto; toss to combine, then add sauce. Once everything is thoroughly coated and the noodles are heated back up, turn off heat and add garlic, toss to combine. Serve immediately, garnishing with chili oil, bonito flakes, toasted sesame seeds, green onion, etc.
