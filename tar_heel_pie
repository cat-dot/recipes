Fudgy Tar Heel Pie
  --Cook's Country

9" single crust pie dough
1 c (6 oz) semisweet chocolate chips
4 tbsp unsalted butter
1/4 c vegetable oil
2 tbsp unsweetened cocoa powder
3/4 c packed (5 1/4 oz) dark brown sugar
2 large eggs
1 tbsp vanilla
3/4 tsp salt
1/4 c (1 1/4 oz) ap flour
1 1/4 c pecans, toasted and chopped coarse

Adjust oven rack to lower middle position and heat oven to 375F. Roll dough into 12" circle on lightly floured workspace. Loosely roll dough around rolling pin and gently unroll it onto 9" pie plate, letting excess dough hang over edge. Ease dough into plate by gently lifting edge of dough with 1 hand while pressing into plate bottom with other. Leave any dough that overhangs in place. Trim overhang to 1/2" beyond lip. Tuck overhang under itself; folded edge should be flush with edge of pie plate. Crimp dough evenly around edge. Wrap loosely in plastic and place in freezer until dough is fully chilled and firm, ~15 min. Line chilled crust with 2x12" squares of parchment, letting parchment lie over edges of dough, and fill with pie weights. Bake until lightly golden around edges, 18-25 min. Carefully remove parchment and weights, rotate pie shell, and continue to bake until center begins to look opaque and slightly drier, 3-6 min. Let cool completely. Reduce oven to 325F. Combine 2/3 c chocolate chips and butter in bowl and microwave at 50% power, stirring often, until melted, ~90 s. Whisk in oil and cocoa until smooth. In separate bowl, whisk sugar, eggs, vanilla, and salt together until smooth. Whisk chocolate mixture into sugar mixture until incorporated. Stir in flour and remaining 1/3 c chocolate chips until just combined. Spread pecans in bottom of pie shell, then pour batter over top, using spatula to level. Bake pie until toothpick inserted in center comes out with thin coating of batter attached, 30-35 min. Let pie cool on wire rack until barely warm, ~1 1/2 hr. Serve. Pie can be reheated, uncovered, in 300F oven until warm throughout, 10-15 min.
