Vegan Cheese Sauce
  --America's Test Kitchen
  
12 oz russet potatoes, peeled and cut into 1" pieces
1 small carrot, peeled and cut into ½-inch pieces (⅓ cup)
2 tablespoons vegetable oil
1 1/2 tbsp nutritional yeast
1/2 tsp distilled white vinegar
1 tsp table salt
1/8 tsp mustard powder

Bring 2 qt water to boil in large saucepan over high heat. Add potatoes and carrot and cook until tender, ~12 min; drain in colander. Combine cooked vegetables, 1/3 c water, oil, nooch, vinegar, salt, and mustard powder in blender. Pulse until chopped and combined, ~10 pulses, scraping down sides of blender jar as needed. (You will need to stop processing to scrape down sides of blender jar several times for mixture to come together.) Process mixture on high speed until very smooth, ~2 min. Serve. (Sauce can be refrigerated in airtight container for up to 3 days; reheat in microwave, stirring every 30 s, until glossy and pourable. Adjust consistency with hot water as needed.)
