Sous-Vide Chocolate Ice Cream

8 oz dark chocolate (70% cocoa), roughly chopped (1½ c)
3 c whole milk
½ c granulated sugar
¼ c unsweetened cocoa powder
1 tbsp honey (preferably wildflower)
2 tsp flaky salt, plus more for garnish
6 egg yolks
¼ c cacao nibs

In a blender, combine all the ingredients, except for the cacao nibs, and purée until the cocoa powder is dissolved and the chocolate is finely chopped. Transfer to a vacuum-seal bag with the cacao nibs and seal shut. Alternatively, place the ingredients in a sealable plastic bag and dip into a large bowl of water to displace the air before sealing shut. Preheat a pot of water fitted with a sous-vide immersion circulator to 185° according to the manufacturer's directions. Cook the ice cream for 45 min, making sure the bag remains completely submerged and shaking the bag occasionally to ensure it cooks evenly. Pour the cooked base into a bowl and whisk to fully incorporate the melted chocolate. Cover with plastic wrap and refrigerate overnight. Make sure you freeze the drum of your ice cream maker while the base chills. The next day, freeze the base in an ice cream machine according to the manufacturer's instructions. Transfer to a shallow sealable container and return to the freezer until set, 3-4 hrs.
