  --Emma Frisch

1 1/2 c almonf flour
finely grated zest of 1 lemon
1/8 tsp fine salt
1/4 c tahini
1/4 c honey
1 tsp olive oil
1/2 tsp vanilla
16 whole almonds or chocolate chips

Preheat oven to 350. Line a rimmed baking sheet with parchment paper. In a large bowl, combine flour, zest, and salt. In a small bowl, whisk together the tahini, honey, olive oil, and vanilla. Pour the wet ingredients into the dry and stir well until combined. Use your hands to form the dough into a large ball. Pinch off ~1 tbsp of the dough at a time and roll into a small ball with the palms of your hands. Place on prepared baking sheet and repeat with the remaining dough, spacing the balls 1-2" apart. Gently press your pinkie finger into the center of each ball to lightly flatten the cookie until it is ~3/4" thick. If desired, press and almond or chocolate chip into the center of each cookie. Bake until the bottom edges of the cookies are toasted brown, 10-12 min. Transfer the cookies to a wire rack to cool. Store in airtight container at room temp for up to 2 weeks, or freeze for up to 3 months.
