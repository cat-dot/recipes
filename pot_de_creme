Pot de Creme

3/4 c egg yolks
1 quart heavy cream
1/2 c sugar
1 vanilla bean, split, seeds removed and reserved
1 c bittersweet chocolate (>= 50%)

Crack the egg yolks into a medium bowl and set aside. In a small quart saucepan over medium-high heat, combine the cream, sugar, and scraped vanilla bean, and bring to a simmer. Ladle some of the hot cream into the bowl with the egg yolks and whisk constantly to prevent curdling. Return the egg and cream mixture to the saucepan over medium-high heat and continue to whisk until thickened, 5-7 min. Remove from heat, still stirring, and add the chocolate all at once. Keep stirring until the chocolate is fully melted and smooth. Divide the chocolate mixture among 4x8oz ramekins. Chill in the refrigerator until set, 2-3 hrs.

Ganache
1 c bittersweet chocolate
3/4 c warmed heavy cream
2 tbsp Grand Marnier or amaretto

In a small bowl, combine the chocolate and warm heavy cream, and let sit, undisturbed, for 3-4 min. Stir until the chocolate is completely melted. Stir in the liquor and set aside.

To serve: remove the pots de creme from the fridge and top with ganache and a sprinkle of cacaoe nibs.
