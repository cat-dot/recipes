  --Sohla El-Waylly
  
Yogurt:
3/4 c whole milk yogurt
2 tbsp fresh lemon juice
1/2 tsp sugar
kosher salt

Whisk yogurt, juice, and sugar in a small bowl to combine. Season with salt. Yogurt can be made 1 day ahead, cover and chill.

Fritters:
1 c red lentils (masoor dal)
1 medium zucchini (~5 oz)
1/2 medium onion, thinly sliced
1 3/4 tsp kosher salt, divided + more
1/2 kashmiri chile powder or 1/4 tsp cayenne
1/4 tsp tumeric
1 c parsley leaves with tender stems
1 tbsp finely grated lemon zest
1 c ghee or neutral vegetable oil

Rinse lentils, then soak in 2 c water at room temp at least 1 hr and up to 12. Cut zucchini into 1/4" thick matchsticks, ~2" long. Transfer to a colander set in a bowl. Add onion and 1 tsp salt and toss to combine. Let sit until ~1 tbsp liquid has released and the vegetables look wilted and soft, 30-120 min. (do this while lentils are soaking) Gently pat dry with paper towels to remove any excess moisture. Drain lentils and transfer to a food processor. Add chile powder, tumeric, and 3/4 tsp salt. Pulse, scraping down sides, until a puree forms. Transfer to a medium bowl and add onion mixture, parsley, and lemon zest. Toss well with spatula to combine. Heat ghee in a 10" cast iron skillet over medium high until a small amount of batter added to the fat excitedly sizzles and sputters. Carefully drop 1/4 c batter into ghee, then flatten to a pancake with the back of large metal spoon dipped into the hot ghee to prevent sticking. Repeat until pan is full (3 more fritters). Fry until deep golden brown on one side, ~3 min. Turn with slotted spatula or large spoon and continue to fry until deep golden brown on second side, ~3 min. Transfer to a wire rack set in a paper towel lined baking sheet to drain. Season immediately with salt. Repeat with remainin batter. Makes 8-10 fritters. Serve with yogurt sauce.


Notes: salt soaking water (if desired), add more spices like paprika, cumin, etc.
