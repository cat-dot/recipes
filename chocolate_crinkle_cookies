Chocolate Crinkle Cookies
  -America's Test Kitchen

1 c (5 oz) ap flour
1/2 c (1 1/2 oz) unsweetened cocoa powder
1 tsp baking powder
1/4 tsp baking soda
1/2 tsp salt
1 1/2 c (10 1.2 oz) brown sugar
3 large eggs
4 tsp instant espresso powder (optional)
1 tsp vanilla
4 oz unsweetened chocolate, chopped
4 tbsp unsalted butter
1/2 c (3 1/2 oz) sugar
1/2 c (2 oz) confectioners' sugar

Adjust oven rack to middle position and heat oven to 325F. Line 2 baking sheets with parchment paper. Whisk flour, cocoa, baking powder, baking soda, and salt together in bowl. Whisk brown sugar; eggs; espresso powder, if using; and vanilla together in large bowl. Combine chocolate and butter in bowl and microwave at 50% power, stirring occasionally, until melted, 2-3 min. Whisk chocolate mixture into egg mixture until combined. Fold in flour mixture until no dry streaks remain. Let dough sit at room temperature for 10 min. Place granulated sugar and confectioners’ sugar in separate shallow dishes. Working with 2 tbsp dough at a time, roll into balls. Drop dough balls directly into granulated sugar and roll to coat. Transfer dough balls to confectioners’ sugar and roll to coat evenly. Evenly space dough balls on prepared sheets, 11/sheet. Bake cookies, 1 sheet at a time, until puffed and cracked and edges have begun to set but centers are still soft (cookies will look raw between cracks and seem underdone), ~12 min, rotating sheet halfway through baking. Let cool completely on sheet before serving.
