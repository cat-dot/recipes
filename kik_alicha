5 large purple onions
1 c olive oil
16 oz. bag yellow split peas
2 tsp tumeric

In large, heavy pot, cover peas with 3‚Äù water. Bring to a boil. Reduce heat to medium low and cook till tender, ~30-45 min. Meanwhile, puree the onions in a food processor or blender. Cook the puree in heavy pot until they're tender and just staring to turn brown (note: they will be dry). Add the olive oil, tumeric and strong pinch of salt, stirring to combine. Add the cooked split peas (water included) to the onion mixture, reduce the heat to a simmer and cook to a consistency similar to pea soup. Stir in garlic and serve with injera.
