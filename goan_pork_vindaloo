Goan Pork Vindaloo
  --Cook's Illustrated

4 large dried guajillo chiles, wiped clean, stemmed, seeded, and torn into 1" pieces (~1 oz)
1 c water, divided
1 1/2" piece ginger, peeled and sliced crosswise 1/8" thick
6 garlic cloves, chopped coarse
1 tbsp paprika
1 tbsp ground cumin
2 tsp loose black tea
2 tsp table salt
1 tsp pepper
1/4 - 1/2 tsp cayenne pepper (optional)
1/2 tsp ground cinnamon
1/2 tsp ground cardamom
1/4 tsp ground cloves
1/4 tsp ground nutmeg
3-3 1/2 lb boneless pork butt roast, trimmed and cut into 1" pieces
1 tbsp vegetable oil
1 large onion, chopped fine
1/3 c cider vinegar

Combine guajillos and 1/2 c water in bowl and microwave until steaming, ~1 1/2 min. Let sit until guajillos are softened, ~10 min. While guajillos soften, adjust oven rack to middle position and heat oven to 325F. Process guajillo mixture; ginger; garlic; paprika; cumin; tea; salt; pepper; cayenne, if using; cinnamon; cardamom; cloves; and nutmeg in blender on low speed until smooth paste forms, 1 1/2 - 2 min. With blender running, add remaining 1/2 c water. Increase speed to high and process for 1 min. Add pork to large bowl; pour spice paste over pork and mix thoroughly. Heat oil in Dutch oven over medium heat until shimmering. Add onion and cook, stirring frequently, until soft and golden, 7-9 min. Add pork mixture and stir to combine. Spread mixture into even layer. Continue to cook until mixture begins to bubble, ~2 min longer. Cover pot, transfer to oven, and cook for 40 min. Stir in vinegar. Cover and return pot to oven. Continue to cook until fork inserted into pork meets little or no resistance, 40-50 min longer. Let stand, uncovered, for 10 min. Stir and serve. (Pork can be cooked up to 3 days in advance.)
