Chocolate Banana Bread

6 oz bittersweet chocolate, chopped for melting
1 1/2 c ap flour
3/4 tsp baking soda
1/4 tsp baking powder
1/4 tsp cinnamon
pinch ground cloves
1 tsp vanilla
3 c ripe bananas, diced (~4)
1/3 c buttermilk, room temp
1/2 c (1 stick) unsalted butter, softened
1 c sugar
2 tbsp vegetable oil
1 large egg, room temp

Position rack in center of oven and preheat to 350F. Butter and flour a 9x5x3" loaf pan; set aside. Put chocolate in heatproof bowl. Either use double boiler method or microwave to melt; keep warm. Whisk flour, baking soda, baking powder, cinnamon, and cloves in medium bowl; set aside. Stir vanilla and half the bananas into buttermilk; set aside. Beat butter and sugar in a large bowl with an electric mixer on medium high until light and fluffy, ~4 min. While mixing, drizzle in the oil and beat until incorporated. Beat in the egg until incorporated. While mixer is on, slowly add flour mixture in 3 additions, alternating with buttermilk mixture in 2 parts. Scrape the sides of the bowl in between additions as needed. Fold the remaining bananas into batter. Gently swirl in chocolate, keeping it marbled. Scoop batter into prepared pan. Bake until a toothpick inserted into the middle comes out clean, ~50 min. Cook in the pan on a rack before unmodling and slicing.


Notes: I make this with ~1 c toasted walnuts, roughtly chopped.
