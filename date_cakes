Warm Date Cakes

Cakes:
1/2 kg (1lb 2oz) pressed pitted dates
1 liter (1 quart) water
15 g (2 tbsp, 1/2 oz) baking soda
400 g (14oz) butter, softened at room temp
400 g (14oz) sugar
7 eggs
1 vanilla bean, slit open
750 g (1lb 6.5oz) flour
15 g (2 tbsp, 1/2 oz) baking powder

Mix dates with water and bring to a boil. Reduce heat and cook for 5 min. Remove from heat, add baking soda, mix and set aside in a warm place. Preheat oven to 170C/340F. Beat softened butter with sugar, add eggs gradually and continue to beat until pale, thick, and fluffy. Slit open the vanilla bean and grate the seeds into the egg mixture. Keep the pod to use in preparing the sauce. Sift flour with baking soda and fold into the egg mixture. Fold in dates and water mixture. Pour the batter into well greased baking pans (3 loaf or 30 muffins or mini babka), filling each 3/4 full, and bake until toothpick comes out dry with a few crumbs adhering, ~1 hr for loaf pans, 35 min for individual cakes.

Toffee:
2/3 c dark brown sugar
50 g (2oz) butter
80 ml (3oz) heavy cream
80 ml (3oz) milk
1 tsp brandy

Bring all ingredients except brandy to a boil, including the reserved vanilla pod. Cook for 5 min until the sauce thickens and cool. Stir in the brandy.

To serve, pour the sauce on slices of cake and heat for 30 s in a microwave.
