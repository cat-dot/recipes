Tempeh Bolognese
  --MinimalistBaker

1 tbsp olive oil
3/4 c finely diced onion or shallot
1 c shiitake or cremini mushrooms, minced
8 oz tempeh, finely chopped or grated
3 cloves garlic, minced
2 tbsp coconut aminos (or 1 tbsp tamari or basalmic vinegar)
1/2 tsp fennel seed
1/2 tsp red pepper flake, adjust to preferred spice level
1/4 c dry red wine (optional)
28 oz can crushed tomatoes
3 tbsp tomato paste
1 tbsp fresh oregano
1-2 tbsp vegan parmesan cheese + more to taste
1-2 tsp sweetener of choice (maple syrup, coconut sugar, etc)
water as needed to thin

Heat large rimmed skillet, pot, or dutch oven over medium heat. Once hot, add oil and onion and saute for 4-5 min until translucent and soft, stirring frequently. Add mushrooms and stir. Saute for 2 min more. Then add tempeh and garlic and stir. Then add aminos, fennel, and pepper flake; saute for 4-5 min, stirring frequently, until everything is golden brown. Turn down heat if browning too quickly. Add wine (if using), stir, and cook for 1 min. Then add tomatoes, tomato paste, oregano, parmesan, and sweetener. Thin with water if needed. Stir to combine and simmger for 10 min. Taste and adjust flavors as needed. Serve with pasta or pasta alternative. Leftovers will keep in refrigerator for up to 5 days, or in the freezer for up to 1 month.


Notes: will probably omit the sweetener and add the paste first, let it caramelize, then add rest of the liquidy ingredients
