Shiitake Mushroom and Herb Broth

40 dried shiitake mushrooms
1/2 medium yellow onion, peeled and quartered
1 c roughly chopped leeks
1 head garlic, split crosswise
4 sprigs thyme
4 sprigs parsely
1 bay leaf
1" strip lemon, peeled using a vegetable peeler
1 tsp black peppercorns

In a large bowl, cover the shiitake mushrooms with 8 c cold water. Place in the fridge for at least 4 hrs, preferrably overnight, making sure the mushrooms are completely submerged in the water. Over a 4q saucepan, strain the shiitake mushrooms, reserving the liquid. Gently squeeze the mushrooms to drain any excess water. Remove the stems and reserve the mushrooms for another use. Add the onions, leeks, garlic, thyme, parsely, bay leaf, lemon, and pepprcorns to the liquid and bring to a boil. Reduce the heat to medium and simmer, stirring occasionally, until the broth is reduced by half, 2 hrs. Strain through a fine-mesh sieve into a large bowl. Cover and chill until ready to use
