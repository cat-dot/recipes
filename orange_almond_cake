Whole Orange Almond Cake    gf, dairy free
  --James Beard Foundation

2 large oranges (preferably seedless navels)
6 eggs
1 1/2 c ground almonds
pinch salt
1 c sugar
1 tsp baking powder

Preheat oven to 400F. Butter and flour a deep 9" cake pan. Bring a large pot of salted water to boil. Wash oranges and place them in the boiling water; cover. Boil until very soft, ~30 min. Drain, cool, cut into quarters, removing any seeds. Process the oranges to a fairly fine puree in a blender or food processor. Beat the eggs in a bowl until thick then add ground almonds, salt, sugar, baking powder, and orange puree. Mix well. Pour into cake pan and bake for 1 hr, or until the cake is firm to the touch. Remove the pan to a rack and allow the cake to cool. Turn it out onto a serving dish.
