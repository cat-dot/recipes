Torta Della Nonna
  --Skye McAlpine

Pastry:
7 tbsp (200g) salted butter
3 c + 3 tbsp (400g) ap flour + more for dusting
1 1/2 c (170g) confectioners' sugar
4 large egg yolks

Process the butter and flour in a food processor until the mixture is the consistency of grainy sand. Remove the blad, then sift the sugar  in with the flour. Add the yolks, and use hands to bring the dough together. If it feels too dry and crumbly, add 1-2 tbsp cold water. Roll the dough into a ball, wrap in plastic, and refrigerate for at least 30 min. Preheat oven to 400F. On a lightly floured surface, roll out the dough into a large disk that is roughly 1/8" thick. Gently lift the dough and lay it into 10" tart pan. Gently press it down into the nooks, then roll over the top of the pan to cut away excess pastry. Prick the bottom of the tart with a fork. Cover with parchment paper and fill with weights or beans. Bake for 15 min or until dry to the touch, then remove weights and parchment, put back into oven, and bake for 5-7 min more, or until pastry is lightly golden. Remove and let cool briefly. Reduce oven temp to 350F.

Filling:
2 c (500mL) whole milk
5 large egg yolks
3/4 c (125g) sugar
1/3 c (40g) ap flour
1 tsp vanilla
1 c (120g) pine nuts

Add milk to medium saucepan set over medium low heat, and slowly heat until it starts steaming and little bubbles strqt rising around the edges. Take care to not let it boil. In a large bowl, whisk the yolks and sugar until pale and fluffy. Sift in the flour and slowly, while continuously whisking, gradually pour in the hot milk. Whisk in the vanilla. Return the mixture to the saucepan over gentle heat and simmer, whisking until it thickens to a rich custard consistency, 4-5 min. Pour the custard into the pastry shell and top with the nuts. Bake for 20-25 min, until golden and just set in the middle. Let cool briefly, then remove the rim of the tart pan. Serve warm.
