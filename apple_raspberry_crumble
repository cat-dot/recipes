Apple Raspberry Oat Crumble

5 medium sweet tart apples (ex gala) ~2lbs
2 tbsp granulated sugar
2 tbsp fresh lemon juice
2 1/2 tsp granluated tapioca
1 tsp cinnamon, divided
sea salt
1 c rolled oats
3 tbsp coconut oil, melted
2 tbsp packed brown sugar
1/2 pint fresh raspberries or 1 c frozen

Peel and quarter the apples, cut out the cores and cut each wedge in half lengthwise. Toss in a bowl with granulated sugar, lemon juice, tapioca, 3/4 tsp cinnamon, and a pinch of salt. Transfer the apple mixture to a 1 1/2 quart baking dish (10x6" oval) and let stand for 20 min to soften the tapioca. Meanwhile, in a small bowl, mix the oats, oil, brown sugar, remaining cinnamon, and a pinch of salt. Set aside: this is a necessary step to moisten the oats. Preheat oven to 400F. Mix up the apples one more time in their dish then cover with foil. Bake the apples for 30 min. Remove from the oven, give the apples a gentle stir and sprinkle the raspberries on top. Top with the oat mixture, reduce the heat to 350F and bake until fruit is bubbly and topping is golden brown, ~30 min more. Let cool 20 min before serving.
