Black Sesame Brittle
  --Sarah Menanix

1 1/2 c cane sugar
2 tbsp water
1/2 c + 3 tbsp roasted black sesame seeds
pinch salt

Line a large baking sheet with parchment paper or a silpat mat. Combine sugar and water in a small saucepan over medium heat. Stir until uniformly mixed, then cook, until mixture bubbles steadily. It will first look like there is crystallized sugar on top and like it won't get smooth, but give it time and using a clean wooden spoon or spatula, stir occasionally, until it turns dark golden brown (at least 305F on a candy thermometer) and, this is important) there are absolutely no crystallized white spots left (use the spoon to stir to break any up!). Working quickly, stir in salt and the black sesame seeds, 1/4 c at a time. Pour onto baking sheet and spread out into a thin even layer,  ~1/8-1/4" thick. Cool for ~15-30 min. Tap gently with a mallet or knife to break it into pieces. Store in an airtight container for up to two weeks.
