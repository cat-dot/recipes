Chili Crisp Cucumber Soba Noodle Salad
  --Yasmeen Ali
  
Sauce:
2 tsp sesame oil
2 tsp shoyu
2 tsp lime juice
2 tsp chili crisp 
1 tsp honey (sub with maple syrup if vegan)
1 tsp white miso paste

Add all the ingredients to a small bowl and whisk together. Alternatively, you can whisk the dressing in the same bowl youâ€™ll use for the salad to minimize dishes. 

1 bundle (4.75 oz or 90 g) soba noodles (love Hakubaku soba noodles)
1/2 c frozen shelled edamame (optional)
2 persian cucumbers or mini cucumbers, thinly mandolin (~120 g)
1/4 c cilantro, finely chopped
3 scallions, thinly sliced on a bias
1/4 c roasted cashews or roasted peanuts, roughly chopped (optional)
Toasted sesame seeds for garnish

Add the noodles to a pot of boiling water along with a large pinch of salt, and cook until soft but still chewy. ~1 min before the noodles are done, add in the frozen edamame to blanch them. Drain and rinse the noodles and edamame in cold water and set aside to drain. Mandoline the cucumbers on the thinnest setting, and add to a large bowl along with the scallions and cilantro. Add the drained noodles and edamame, pour over the dressing, and toss together. Adjust for salt as needed, and top with a generous amount of toasted sesame seeds.


Notes: for gf option, use rice noodles
