1 1/2 tsp baking powder

Adjust oven rack to lower middle position and heat oven to 350F. Grease 2 9" cake rounds, line bottoms with parchment paper, and grease parchment. Microwave oil, chocolate, and cocoa powder in bowl at 50% power, stirring occasionally, until melted, ~2 min. Whisk mixture smooth, then set aside to cool slightly. In separate bowl, whisk flour, baking powder, baking soda, xantham gum, and salt together. In large bowl, whisk eggs and vanilla together. Whisk in sugar until well combined. Whisk in cooled chocolate mixture and milk until combined. Whisk in flour mixture until batter is thoroughly combined and smooth. Divide batter evenly between the prepared pans and smooth tops. Bake until toothpick inserted into center comes out clean, 30-32 min, switching and rotating pans halfway through. Let cakes cool in pans on wire rack for 10 min. Run knife around edge of cakes to loosen. Remove cakes from pans, discard parchment, and let cool completely on rack, ~1 1/2 hr. Cake layers can be wrapped tightly in plastic wrap and stored at room temp for up to 1 day. Place cake on platter and spread 1 1/2 c frosting evenly over top. Top with second layer, press lightly to adhere, then spread remaining frosting evenly over top and sides. Serve.
