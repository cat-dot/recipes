oil for frying
1 c ap flour
1 c rice flour
1 c cornstarch
1 tsp baking powder
2 c soy milk
sesame seeds for garnish

Bring a large pot of salted water to boil and prepare an ice bath. Blanch the cauliflower in the boiling water for 2 min, then transfer to the ice bath to cool. Drain well. In a large, heavy-bottomed pot, heat 2" of oil to 350F and line a plate with paper towels. In a large bowl, whisk together the flours, cornstarch, and baking powder until incorporated. Transfer 1/3 of the mixture to another large bowl and whisk in the soy milk. Add the florets to the milk mixture and toss to coat. Drain the excess liquid and dredge in the flour mixture, being sure to shake off any excess. Working in batches, fry the cauliflower until crips and golden, 4-5 min per batch, then transfer to the prepared plate to drain. Heat the skillet with the reserved sauce over medium heat to warm through. Add the fried cauliflower and toss to coat. Transfer to a serving plate and garnish with sesame seeds and scallions.
