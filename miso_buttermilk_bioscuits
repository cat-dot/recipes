  --Claire Saffitz

1/2 c sweet white miso (4.8 oz / 136g)
1 1/4 c buttermilk (10.6 oz / 300g), chilled
3 1/4 c ap flour (15 oz / 423g) + more for rolling
1 tbsp baking powder (0.42 oz / 12g)
1 tbsp sugar (0.46 oz / 13g)
1/4 tsp baking soda
2 sticks unsalted butter (8 oz / 227g), cut into 1/2" pieces, chilled, + 2 tbsp (1 oz/ 28g), melted for brushing
freshly ground black pepper (optional)

Mix miso and buttermilk until well combined; set aside. Whisk dry ingredients together in a large bowl. Make a well in dry ingredients, pour in miso mixture and stir to combine. Turn out onto floured surface and form into an 8x8" square. Cut into 4 equal pieces, and layer them on top one another. Press lightly to adhere, then roll out again to 8x8" square. Cut into 16 equal pieces, put on a plate and chill either in refrigerator or freezer. Preheat oven to 425F, place biscuits on parchment lined baking sheet and brush tops with butter. Sprinkle with pepper if using. Put sheet in oven and turn temp down to 375 and bake for 20-25 min. Let cool before eating.



Notes: Can freeze some/all and put straight into oven from freezer, just may take a little longer on the bake time.
