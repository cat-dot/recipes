4 slices bacon (~4 oz) chopped fine
1 medium onion chopped fine (~1 c)
1 small green bell pepper, seeded and chopped fine (~1/2 c)
3 medium garlic cloves, minced (~1 tbsp)
1 celery rib, chopped fine (~1/2 c)
1 tsp fresh thyme leaves
1 tsp sweet paprika
2 bay leaves
1/4 tsp cayenne
ground black pepper
3 c low sodium chicken broth
6 c water
8 oz andouille sausage, halved lengthwise and cut into 1/4" slices
1 tsp red wine veingar

Dissolve 3 tbsp salt in 4 qts cold water in large bowl or container. Add beans and soak at room temp for at least 8 hrs and up to 24 hrs. Drain and rinse well. Heat bacon in large dutch oven over medium heat, stirring occasionally, until browned and almost fully rendered, 5-8 min. Add onion, green pepper, and celery; cook, stirring frequently, until vegetables are softened, 6-7 min. Stir in garlic, thyme, paprika, bay leaves, cayenne, and 1/4 tsp black pepper; cook until fragrant, ~30 s. Stir in beans, broth, and water; bring to boil over high heat. Reduce heat and vigorously simmer, stirring occasionally, until beans are just soft and liquid begins to thicken, 45-60 min. Stir in sausage and vinegar and cook until liquid is thick and beans are fully tender and creamy, ~30 min. Season to taste with salt, black pepper, and additional vinegar. Serve over rice, sprinkling with scallions and passing hot sauce if desired.


Notes: If you are pressed for time, can quick bring beans. Instead of overnight soak, bring to a boil over high heat. Remove pot from the heat, cover, and let stand 1 hr. Drain and rinse and proceed with recipe. If using tasso, skip bacon and paprika; cook 4 oz in 2 tsp oil until lightly browned, 4-6 min.
