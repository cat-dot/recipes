Fried Brussel Sprout Salad

Squash:
1 small (1 lb and 12 oz) butternut squash, peeled and cored
2 tbsp canola oil
1 tbsp honey
1 tsp chile oil
3 garlic cloves, minced
2" ginger nub, peeled and minced
kosher salt to taste

Preheat oven to 350F. Cut the squash into 1/2" thick, 1" wide square pieces and set aside. In a small food processor, add the oils, honey, garlic, and ginger, and puree until a smooth paste forms. In a large bowl, toss the squash with the paste until it's fully coated and season with salt. Place the squash on a parchment lined sheet tray and roast in the oven until the squash is tender, 25-30 min.

Dressing:
1/4 c sichuan hot pot sauce
1/4 c lime juice
2 tbsp sambal
1/4 c canola oil
kosher salt to taste

In a small bowl, whisk all the ingredients except the oil. While vigorously whisking, stream in the oil to emulsify. Season with salt and reserve for later.

Salad:
canola oil for frying
1 lb brussels sprouts, quartered
kosher salt to taste
5 c (2 lbs) small napa cabbage, stems removed and leaves torn by hand
roasted butternut squash
1/2 c fried shallots + more for garnish
1/2 c cashews, roasted and roughly chopped + more for garnish
1/2 c cilantro leaves, torn
1/2 c mint leaves, torn + mint tip for garnish
1/2 c thai basil leaves, torn

In a heavy bottom pot, bring 2" of oil to 350F. In batches, carefully fry the sprouts until golden brown, crispy, and tender on the inside, 3-5 min. Remove from oil and place on a paper towel lined plate, and season lightly with salt. Transfer the fried sprouts to a large bowl and coat generously with the dressing. Add the remaining ingredients and gently toss with more dressing as needed. Garnish with more fried shallots and cashews, and top with a mint tip.
