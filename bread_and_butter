Bread and butter pickles

1 lb kirby cucumbers (can use jalapenos)
2 tbsp coarse kosher salt
3 large sprigs fresh dill
1/4 c light brown sugar
1/3 c cider vinegar
2 tsp coriander seeds
1/2 tsp black peppercorns
1/4 tsp allspice berries

Trim ends from cucumbers and slice into 1/4" rounds. In a colander set over a plate, toss them with salt. Refrigerate, uncovered, for 2 hrs. Drain and transfer cucumbers and dill to a bowl. In a small saucepan, combine sugar, vinegar, coriander, peppercorns, and allspice. Bring to a boil and cook until sugar dissolves. Pour hot liquid over cucumbers and toss well. Let stand, tossing every 10 min, for 30 min. Transfer to an airtight jar and refrigerate for up to 1 week.
