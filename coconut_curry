Slow Cooker Coconut Curry Chicken

2 lb boneless, skinless chicken breasts or thighs, cut into cubes
5 large carrots, peeled and diced
1 medium onion, peeled and quartered
2 cloves garlic, peeled
1 large bell pepper, seeded and chopped
5 oz can tomato paste
14 oz can coconut milk
1 1/2 tsp salt
1 tbsp curry paowder
1 tbsp garam masala
1 jalapeno, seeded and halved or 1 tsp crushed red pepper flakes
2 tbsp water
1 1/2 tsp cornstarch

Grease the slow cooker with cooking spray. Place the chicken and carrots on the bottom of the slow cooker. Place the rest of the ingredients (except the cornstarch and water) in a food processor and process until mostly smooth. If your food processor is too small to hold everything, process without the coconut milk; transfer to a medium bowl and mix in the coconut milk. Pour sauce over the chicken and carrots, mix well, then cover and cook on low for ~6 hrs. An hour or so before serving, mix cornstarch and water in a small bowl. Pour into slow cooker, stir to combine, and continue cooking for 1 hr. Serve over rice with naan and garnish with cilantro.


*If you want more chunks, cut bell pepper into larger pieces and place with the chicken and carrots.
