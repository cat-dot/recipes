Adjust oven rack to lowest position and heat oven to 425F. Toss broccoli with 2 tbsp oil, ½ tsp salt, and ¼ tsp pepper. Brush rimmed baking sheet with 1 tbsp oil.

Flip sausage, stir broccoli, and continue to roast until sausage is browned on second side, ~12 min longer. Transfer sausage to platter; leave broccoli on sheet and set aside.
