Very Chocolatey Chocolate Brownies

8 oz (225g) high quality semi sweet chocolate
1/2 c (120ml) melted coconut oil
3 tbsp ground chia seeds
3/4 c (180ml) espresso or strong black coffee at room temp
1 1/4 c (250g) packed light brown sugar
1 tsp vanilla
3/4 c (105g) whole wheat pastry flour
1/2 tsp salt
1/4 tsp baking soda
2/3 c (75g) chopped walnuts

Position a rack in the lower third of the oven and preheat to 350F. Grease an 8x8" baking pan with coconut oil. Cover the bottom of the pan with a piece of parchment paper, and then grease the top of the paper. Chop 3 oz of the chocolate into pieces no larger than chocolate chips; set aside. Break the remaining 5 oz of the chocolate into pieces about 1/2" wide and put them in the top of a double boiler or in a bowl suspended over a pan of barely simmering water. Stir frequently, until the chocolate is melted and smooth. Remove from the heat and transfer chocolte to a large mixing bowl. Stir in the oil, and let cool for 10-15 min. Put the chia sees in a small mixing bowl and whisk in the coffee. Let site 5-10 min until it thickens (egg substitue). Whisk again to make sure there are no lumps. Whisk the sugar into the chocolate mixture. Add the vanilla and the chia mixture and whisk vigorously until blended. In a medium mixing bowl, whisk together the flour, salt, and baking soda. Stir the flour mixture into the chocolate mixture, then fold in the reserved chocolate and the walnuts. Do not overmix. Transfer the batter to the prepared pan and bake for 40-50 min, until the top feels dry and the brownies feel firm when a toothpick is inserted in the center. Watch closely during final minutes to make sure edges don't burn. Transfer the pan to a wire rack to cool. These are best when they cool overnight or are refrigerated for 2 hrs after they come to room temp. The brownies will stay fresh at room temp for ~5 days in an airtight container.
