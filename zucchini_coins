Crunchy Zucchini Coins
 - Rachael (aka Spache the Spatula)

2 tbsp group flax
1/4 c + 2 tbsp water
1 large garlic clove, minced
1 to 2 zucchinis, sliced in 1/2‚Äù coins (I used 1 zucchini and a large pattypan squash)
1 c panko bread crumbs
1/3 c nutritional yeast
kosher salt

Preheat oven to 400F. Spray a baking sheet with nonstick spray. Sprinkle the zucchini with salt and allow to sit for 10-15 min. In a small bowl, combine the flax, water, and garlic and allow to sit for 10-15 min until it thickens up a bit. In a medium bowl, combine the panko, nutritional yeast, and a pinch of kosher salt. Dry the zucchini off with a paper towel. Dip each zucchini coin into the flax mixture, and then into the panko mixture. Use your fingers or a spoon to really press the panko mixture onto the coins. Bake for 10 min, flip, then bak for another 10 min. Serve with dipping sauce of choice.
