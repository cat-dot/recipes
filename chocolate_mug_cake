Chocolate Mug Cake
  --Julie Wampler, Table for Two
  
1/4 c ap flour
2 tbsp cocoa powder
1/4 tsp baking powder
2 tbsp sugar (can add 1 tbsp more if you want it sweeter)
1/8 tsp salt
1/4 c + 1 tbsp milk
2 tbsp vegetable oil
1 tbsp hazelnut chocolate spread or mini chocolate chips (optional)

In a medium bowl, whisk together dry ingredients. Whisk in the milk and vegetable oil until all ingredients are combined and the batter has no clumps. Pour batter into a microwave safe mug (14oz works, need room for cake to rise). Add hazelnut spread or chips in the middle of the batter, no need to push it down. Place a paper towel in the microwave for insurance and set mug on top. Microwave for 70 s on high. Carefully remove from microwave and enjoy!


Notes: Microwaves vary, the 70 s on high was done in a 950 W microwave.
