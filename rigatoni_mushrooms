Rigatoni with Mushrooms and Butternut Squash

Mushrooms:
6 oz shiitake mushrooms, stems removed
6 oz baby bella mushrooms, sliced
6 oz oyster mushrooms, sliced
1/4 c olive oil
2 garlic cloves
2 rosemary sprigs
2 thyme sprigs
salt and freshly ground black pepper

Preheat oven to 400F. In a large bowl, toss together the mushrooms, olive oil, garlic, rosemary, and thyme, then season with salt and pepper to taste. Lay out the mushrooms evenly on a baking sheet and roast for 20 min, tossing them every 5 min. Remove from the oven and set aside.

Puree:
1 tsp whole black peppercorns
1 tsp coriander seeds
1 tsp cumin seeds
1 rosemary sprig
1 thyme sprig
1 small (10 oz) butternut squash, peeled and cut into 1" cubes
salt to taste

In a small square cheesecloth, arrange the peppercorns, coriander, cumin, rosemary, and thyme, and use butcher's twine to tie the ends together into a sachet. In a medium pot, add the squash and the sachet, and cover completely with water so it rises to 2" above the squash. Season with salt and bring to a boil over high heat. Reduce to a simmer and cook until the squash is soft, 15 min. Strain the squash, reserving 1/2 c of the liquid, and add to a blender. Blend until the squash is smooth and adjust the consistency with the cooking liquid to medium thickness. Keep warm and set aside for later.

Saute:
1 box rigatoni
3 tbsp unsalted butter
4 oz brussel sprouts, stems removed and leaves separated into petals
1 tbsp lemon juice
1 tsp lemo zest
pecorino romano, shaved, for garnish

In a large saute pan, melt the butter over medium heat. Add the brussel sprout leaves and saute until they are barely cooked, 2 min. Toss in the cooked pasta, roast mushrooms, lemon juice and zest, and cook until the pasta and mushrooms are cooked through, 2 min. Spoon the warm butternut suqash puree over the bottom of a large serving platter, spoon the pasta over the puree, garnish with cheese, then serve.
