1 1/2 tsp kosher salt
2 tbsp canola oil
1 lb ground pork
8 oz cherry tomatoes, chopped

Place chiles in a small bowl and cover with boiling water. Let the chiles soak for 20 min to soften, then drain. In a large mortar and pestle (or food processor), pound/pulse the ghiles, garlic, shallots, shrimp paste, and salt until a coarse paste forms. Makes 3/4 c. In a large skillet, heat the oil over medium heat. Add the chile paste and cook until fragrant, 2-3 min. Add the pork and cook until the pork is no longer pink, 5 min. Add the tomatoes and cook until the tomatoes have completely softened and the pork is cooked through, 10-15 min. Remove from heat and stir in the cilantro and scallions
