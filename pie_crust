Pie Crust

2 tbsp white distilled vinegar
2 tbsp vodka
1/3 c ice-cold water
ice
2 1/2 c ap flour
1 tbsp sugar
1 tsp salt
1/2 c shortening, chilled and cut into 1/2" pieces
1/2 c (1 stick) unsalted butter, chilled and cut into 1/2" cubes

In a small liquid measuring cup, combine the vinegar, vodka, and water. Fill with ice and chill until ready to use. In a large bowl, whisk together the flour, sugar, and salt. Add the shortening and use a pastry cutter to cut the fat into the flour, creating cornmeal-size pieces. Add he butter cubes and cut into the flour until the mixture resembles a coarse meal, with a few pea-size butter pieces. Pour 1/4 c of the liquid mixture over the flour and stir with a fork. Add another 3-6 tbsp of liquid and with your fingertips, briefly mix into a shaggy dough. Divide the dough in half. Gather one half into a loose ball and wrap it in plastic wrap, using the plastic as an aid to tuck and seal the dough into a smooth 4" disc. Chill in the fridge for at least 1 hr or up to 3 days. Can freeze for up to 1 month.
