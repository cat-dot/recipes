Churro Ice Cream Cones
  --Genius Kitchen

1 1/2 c ap flour
3 tbsp sugar, divided
1 tsp salt
1/2 tsp dry yeast
1 egg, separated
1/3 c milk, warmed
2 tbsp melted butter
2 tsp cinnamon

In a bowl, stir flour, 2 tbsp sugar, salt, and yeast. In another bowl, stir warm milk and yolk. Add to the flour mixture. Knead until smooth; add butter and continue until it's smooth and elastic. Cover the bowl with a damp cloth and let stand in a warm area until the dough doubles in size, ~1-2 hrs. Divide the dough into 4 pieces. Roll them into 16" long strands, about 1/2-1" thick. Cover loosely and let rest in warm area for ~15 min. Preheat oven to 350F. Mix remaining sugar and cinnamon; set aside. Using a quarter sheet of paper, create a cone. Staple it and cover with aluminum foil. Wrap the dough around the cone mold. Repeat for the remaining dough. Brush the cones with egg white and sprinkle with or roll in the sugar cinnamon mix. Bake for 15 min. Remove from the oven and let cool.


Notes: DO NOT USE TAPE! Use 1 shee white paper cut into fourths, staples, and foil. Another suggestion is using manilla folders.
Other recipes suggest melting chocolate and brushing the interior of the cones with it (or nutella). Can drizzle chocolate syrup, etc over top of ice cream - be creative.
