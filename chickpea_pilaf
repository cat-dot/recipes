Chickpea Pilaf

2 tbsp olive oil
1 small onion, finely diced
2 garlic cloves, minced
1 1/2 c long grain rice (or basmati)
2 cans of chickpeas, drained
2 /12 c water
2 tsp cumin powder
2 tsp coriander powder
2 tsp garam masala powder (or curry or 1/2 tsp coriander + 1/2 tsp all spice)
1 tsp salt
black pepper

Heat olive oil in a large saucepan over medium high heat. Add the onion and garlic and saute until the onion is translucent ~ 3 min. Add the rice and stir until the rice becomes translucent, coated with the oil. Add remaining ingredients. Place the lid on and bring to a boil, then turn the heat down to low. Cook for 12-15 min or until all the liquid has been absorbed. Remove from the stove leaving the lid on, and set aside to rest for 10 min. Fluff the rice up with a fork and serve.
