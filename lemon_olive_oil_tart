Lemon Olive Oil Tart
  --Cook's Illustrated

Crust:
1 1/2 c (7 1/2 oz) ap flour
5 tbsp (2 1/4 oz) sugar
1/2 tsp salt
1/2 c evoo
2 tbsp water

Adjust oven rack to middle position and heat oven to 350F. Whisk flour, sugar, and salt together in bowl. Add oil and water and stir until uniform dough forms. Using your hands, crumble 3/4 of dough over bottom of 9" tart pan with removable bottom. Press dough to even thickness in bottom of pan. Crumble remaining dough and scatter evenly around edge of pan, then press crumbled dough into fluted sides of pan. Press dough even thickness. Place pan on rimmed baking sheet and bake until crust is deep golden brown and firm to touch, 30-35 min, rotating pan halfway though baking.

Filling:
1 c (7 oz) sugar
2 tbsp ap flour
1/4 tsp salt
3 large eggs + 3 yolks
1 tbsp grated lemon zest + 1/2 c juice (~3 lemons)
1/4 c evoo

About 5 min before crust is finished baking, whisk sugar, flour, and salt in medium saucepan until combined. Whisk in eggs and yolks until no streaks of egg remain. Whisk in lemon zest and juice. Cook over medium low heat, whisking constantly and scraping corners of saucepan, until mixture thickens slightly and registers 160F, 5-8 min. Off heat whisk in oil until incorporated. Strain curd through fine mesh strainer and set over bowl. Pour curd into warm tart shell. Bake until filling is set and barely jiggles when pan is shaken, 8-12 min. Let tart cool completely on wire rack, at least 2 hrs. Remove outer metal ring of tart pan. Slide thin metal spatula between tart and pan bottom, then carefully slide tart onto serving platter. Cut tart into wedges, wiping knife clean between cuts if necessary, and serve. Leftovers can be wrapped loosely in plastic wrap and refrigerated for up to 3 days.
