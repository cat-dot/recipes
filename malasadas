Malasadas
  --Cook's Country
  
2 1/4 c (12 1/3 oz) bread flour
1/4 c (1 3/4 oz) sugar + 1 c for coating
2 1/4 tsp instant or rapid rise yeast
1/2 tsp salt
3/4 c whole milk
2 large eggs
2 tbsp unsalted butter, melted and cooled
1 tbsp + 2 quarts vegetable oil, divided

Whisk flour, sugar, yeast, and salt together in a bowl of stand mixer. Whisk milk, eggs, and butter in separate bowl until combined. Add milk mixture to flour mixture. Fit mixer with dough hook and mix on low speed until dough comes together, ~2 min. Increase speed to medium and knead until dough is uniform, shiny, and sticky, ~8 min, dough will not clear bottom or sides of bowl. Using greased rubber spatula, transfer dough to greased large bowl. Cover with plastic wrap and let rise at room temp until doubled in size, 1 1/2-2 hr. Brush rimmed baking sheet with 1 tbsp oil. Turn dough onto sheet and gently press down to deflate. Divide dough into 12 equal pieces and evenly space on sheet. Using greased hands, pat each piece into 3 1/2" disk ~3/8" thick. Cover sheet with plastic and let dough rise at room temp until puffy, 30-45 min. Set wire rack in second rimmed baking sheet. Add remaining oil to large dutch oven until it measures ~1 1/2" deep and heat over medium high heat to 350F. Gently drop 4 disks into hot oil and fry until golden brown, ~3 min, flipping halfway through frying. Adjust burner if necessary, to maintain oil temp between 325-350F. Using slotted spoon or skimmer, transfer malsadas to prepared wire rack. Return oil to 350F and repeat with remaining disks in 2 batches. Place remaining sugar in large bowl. Lightly toss malasadas, one at a time, in sugar to coat. Transfer to platter and serve immediately.
