  --America's Test Kitchen

1 1/2 c walnuts
2 1/2 c (7 1/2 oz) old fashioned rolled oats
1 c raw sunflower seeds
1 c dried apricots
1 c packed (7 oz) brown sugar
3/4 tsp salt
1/2 c vegetable oil
3 tbsp water
1 1/2 c (1 1/2 oz) rice krispies
1 c dried cranberries

Adjust oven rack to middle position and heat to 350F. MAke foil sling for 13x9" baking sheet by folding 2 long sheets of foil; first sheet should be 13" wide and second sheet should be 9" wide. Lay sheets in pan perpendicular to each other, with extra foil hanging over the edges of pan. Push foil into corners and up sides of pan, smoothing foil flush to pan. Lightly spray foil with vegetable spray. Pulse walnuts in food processor until finely chopped, 8-10 pulses. Spread walnuts, oats, and sunflower seeds on rimmed baking sheet and toast until lightly browned and fragrant, 12-15 min, stirring halfway through. Reduce oven temp to 300F. While nuts are toasting, process apricots, sugar, and salt in food processor until apricots are finely ground, ~15 s. With processor running, add oil and water. Continue to process until homogenous paste forms, ~1 min. Transfer paste to large, wide bowl. Add warm nuts to bowl and stir with rubber spatula until well coated. Add cereal and cranberries and stir gently until ingredients are evenly mixed. Transfer mixture to prepared pan and spread into even layer. Place 14" sheet of parchment or waxed paper on top and press and smooth very firmly with your hands, especially at edges and corners, until it is level and compact. Remove parchment and bake until fragrant and just beginning to brown around edges, ~25 min. Transfer pan to wire rack and let cool for 1 hr. Using sling, lift out of pan. Return to wire rack and let cool completely, ~ 1 hr. Discard foil and transfer to cutting board. Using chef's knife, cut in half crosswise to create 2 6 1/2x9" rectangles. Cut each in half again, making 4 3 1/4x9" strips; cut each strip crosswise into 6 equal pieces. Can be stored at room temp up to 3 weeks.

Variations:
1. Substitute blanched hazelnuts for walnuts, chopped dried cherried for cranberries, stir in 1/4 c cacao nibs with cereal.
2. Omit walnuts and cranberries; toast 1 c pepitas, 1/4 c sesame seeds, and 1/4 c chia seeds with oats; increase cereal to 2 c.
