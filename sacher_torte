Sacher Torte
  -Eduard Sacher

Cake:
7 eggs separated
5.3 oz softened butter + more for pan
4.5 oz confectioners' sugar
7 oz dark chocolate
8g vanilla sugar
4.5 oz crystal sugar
pinch of salt
5.3 oz flour + more for pan

Melt the chocolate slowly (double boiler). Meanwhile, cream the butter with the confectioners' sugar and vanilla sugar. gradually stir in yolks. Preheat oven to 180C. Grease a cake form with butter and sprinkle with flour. Whip the egg whites with a pinch of salt, add the crystal sugar, and beat to a stiff peak. Stir the melted chocolate into the paste with the yolks and folf in the egg whites alternately with the flour. Pour into the form and bake for ~1 hr. Remove the cake and let cool. To achieve a flat surface, turn the cake out onto a work surface immediately after baking and turn it again after 25 min.

Glaze:
7 oz dark chocolate coating or cooking chocolate
5.8 oz sugar
~10 tbsp water

Break the chocolate into smal pieces. Heat up the water with the sugar for a few minutes. Pour into a bowl and leave to cool down until just warm to the taste (if it is too hot it will become dull in appearance, if tool cold it will become too viscous.) Add the chocolate and dissolve in the sugar solution.

Assembly:
5-7 oz apricot jam
rum (optional)
whipped cream for garnish

If the apricot jam is too solid, heat it briefly and stir until smooth before flavoring with a shot of rum. Cut the cake in half crosswise. Cover the base with jam, set the other half on top, and coat the upper surface and around the edges with jam. Pour the glaze quickly in a single action, over the cake and immediately spread out and smooth it over the surface. Leave the cake to dry at room temp. Serve with a garnish of whipped cream.

Note: If possible, do not store in the fridge as otherwise it will sweat.
