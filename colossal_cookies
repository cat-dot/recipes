Colossal Cookies

1/2 c butter or margarine
1 1/2 c sugar
1 1/2 c firmly packed brown sugar

1 tsp vanilla
18 oz jar (2 c) chunk style peanut butter
18 oz tube (6 c) quick or old fashioned oats, uncooked
6 oz (1 c) semi sweet chocolate pieces
2 1/2 tsp baking soda

Preheat oven to 350F. In 8 qt saucepot or turkey roaster, beat together butter and sugar; blend in eggs and vanilla. Add peanut butter; mix well. Stir in oats, chocolate pieces, and soda, mixing well. Drop by scant 1/4 c dry measure ~4" apart onto ungreased cookie sheet. Flatten with fork to 2 1/2" in diameter. Bake for 10-12 min. Cool 1 min on cookie sheet; remove to wire rack. Store in airtight container. Makes 4 1/2 dozen.

Note: To freeze cookie dough, measure scant 1/4 c dough for each cookie. Place on cookie sheet, do not flatten. Freeze until firm. Store in airtight container in freezer. When ready to bake, place dough on ungreased cookie sheet and let stand at room temp ~30 min. Flatten with fork and bake as directed.

For smaller cookies, drop dough by tablespoon; flatten to 1 1/4" diameter, bake at 375F for 8-10 min. Makes ~9 dozen.
