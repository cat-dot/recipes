Coronation Quiche

Pastry:
125g plain flour
Pinch of salt
25g cold butter, diced
25g lard
2 tbsp milk
Or 1 x 250g block of ready-made shortcrust pastry

Sieve the flour and salt into a bowl; add the fats and rub the mixture together using your finger tips until you get a sandy, breadcrumb like texture. Add the milk a little at a time and bring the ingredients together into a dough. Cover and allow to rest in the fridge for 30-45 min. Lightly flour the work surface and roll out the pastry to a circle a little larger than the top of the tin and ~5mm thick. Line the tin with the pastry, taking care not to have any holes or the mixture could leak. Cover and rest for a further 30 min in the fridge. Preheat the oven to 190C. Line the pastry case with greaseproof paper, add baking beans and bake blind for 15 min, before removing the greaseproof paper and baking beans. Reduce the oven temperature to 160C.

Filling:
125ml milk
175ml double cream
2 medium eggs
1 tbsp chopped fresh tarragon, 
Salt and pepper
100g grated cheddar cheese,
180g cooked spinach, lightly chopped
60g cooked broad beans or soya beans

Beat together the milk, cream, eggs, herbs and seasoning. Scatter 1/2 of the grated cheese in the blind-baked base, top with the chopped spinach and beans and herbs, then pour over the liquid mixture. If required gently give the mixture a delicate stir to ensure the filling is evenly dispersed but be careful not to damage the pastry case. Sprinkle over the remaining cheese. Place into the oven and bake for 20-25 min until set and lightly golden.
