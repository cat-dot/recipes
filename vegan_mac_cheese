Vegan Mac n Cheese

1 1/2 lbs pasta (I prefer quinoa elbows)
---Sauce---
1 1/2 c unsweetened non-dairy milk
1 1/2 c nutritional yeast
1 c canola/vegetable oil
1 c water
1/3 c tamari or shoyu
1/4 (12 oz) block of firm tofu
1 tbsp garlic powder
1 tbsp paprika
1 tbsp vegesal (or salt)
1 dollop mustard, optional

Preheat oven to 350F. Boil water and cook pasta per package instructions, aiming for al dente. Add all of the sauce ingretients in a blender and process until smooth. Once pasta is cooked, drain and put in oven safe dish. Pour the sauce over the pasta. Bake until the top looks slightly brown and crispy, ~15 min.

Notes:
baking dish I used is 9x13 or standard casserole
skip water for the sauce
I end up using the whole block of tofu and reducing the oil (probably why I don't need water)
I prefer low sodium shoyu and probably use less salt than is called for, ymmv
definitely do not like the taste when I tried liquid aminos instead of shoyu/tamari (use tamari for gf)
have never tried with regular milk but I'm sure it would be ok, just not vegan :)
I tend to use brown/spicy mustard as no type was specified in original recipe
topped with gf panko bread crumbs 
for more adult/fancy - added caramelized onion and suateed mushrooms to cooked pasta before pouring sauce over

for blending, I found getting the tofu pureed with liquid before adding in dry spices led to a smoother blend and less stopping and scraping of the sides
can make the sauce while the pasta is cooking
