Pasta al Limone
  --Molly Baz

1 lemon
12 oz spaghetti
kosher salt
3/4 c heavy cream
6 tbsp unsalted butter
3 oz finely grated parmesan (~3/4 c)
freshly ground black pepper

Remove 2x2" strips of lemon zest; julienne and set aside. Finely grate remaining zest into a large pot/dutch oven. Cut lemon in half and juice; set aside 2 tbsp. Cook pasta in another large pot of boiling, heavily salted water, stirring occasionally, until very al dente. Meanwhile, add cream to pot with lemon zest and cook over medium heat, whisking often, until liquid is just beginning to simmer, ~2 min. Reduce heat to medium low. Whisk in butter 1 tbsp at a time until melted and sauce is creamy and emulsified. Remove from heat. Scoop out 1 1/2 c pasta water; add 3/4 c to cream sauce and return it to medium heat. Usoing tongs, transfer al dente pasta to sauce. Cook, tossing often and adding parmesan cheese little by little, until cheese is melted and sauce is creamy, ~3 min. If sauce looks tight, add more pasta water 1-2 tbsp at a time. Stir in lemon juice; season with more salt if needed. Serve, garnishing with lemon zest strips and fresh ground black pepper.


Notes: can also garnish with some fresh herbs (parsley, rosemary, thyme)
