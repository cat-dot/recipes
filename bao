Dough:
4 c flour
3/4 tsp dry yeast
500 ml water

Mix flour and yeast in a bowl; add water and knead. If it gets too sticky, add more flour, if it's too dry, add more water. Let the dough rest for ~2 hrs.

Filling:
1 lb ground pork
1 lb chinese cabbage, minced
1 carrot, minced
2-3 green onion stalks, chopped
1 egg
1-2 tsp ground ginger
1 tsp olive oil
1/2 tsp chicken bouillon powder
1 tsp oyster sauce
2-3 tsp cooking wine
salt and pepper

Cook half the pork in a pan, and mix with the raw pork. Add all other ingredients and combine. Roll out the dough using "windmill technique" (roll into a thick disc, punch a hole in the middle and smooth out; cut and make into long rope). Cut the dough into 1/2" pieces and roll out to form wrappers. Spoon 1/2 tbsp of filling into center of wrapper. Carefully pinch and fold wrapper closed, twisting top to finish. Make sure to press the dough tight to seal. Bring a pot of water to a boil. Place the baos in a steaming basket lined with cabbage leaves to prevent sticking and place the basket on top of the pot of boiling water. Close lid and steam for 15 min, then turn off heat and let boas rest for 5 min.
