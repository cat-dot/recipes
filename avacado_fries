Avocado Fries
 --Nick Evans  
 
3 slightly under-ripe avocados
1 c panko breadcrumbs
1/2 c grated Parmesan cheese
1/2 tsp black pepper
2 large eggs, whisked
Nonstick cooking spray for air fryer
Coarse salt, optional
Fresh lime juice, optional

Cut the avocados in half and remove the pits. Use a large spoon to scoop out each avocado half in one piece. Slice each half into 5 slices, lengthwise. In a medium bowl, stir together panko breadcrumbs, parmesan cheese, and black pepper. Whisk eggs together in a separate bowl. Dip each avocado slice in egg and then coat well with panko mixture. Spray the air fryer basket with nonstick spray. Place as many avocado fries as possible, without touching, into the air fryer basket. You should be able to fit a whole avocado (10 fries). Air fry the fries at 350F for 3 min per side. They should be crispy and golden brown. Repeat with the remaining batches. Alternatively, bake the avocado slices in a 350F oven for 10-12 min, or until they're golden brown. Let the fries cool briefly before serving. Sprinkle with salt and lime juice, if desired, or serve with the dipping sauce. Cooked avocado fries don't keep very well, so only cook as many as you intend to eat!
