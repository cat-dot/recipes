White Cake
  --Robyn from add a pinch

1 c (2 sticks) butter, softened
1/2 c vegetable shortening
3 c sugar
5 eggs, room temp
3 c ap flour
2 tsp baking powder
1/4 tsp salt
1/2 c whole milk, room temp
1/2 c buttermilk, room temp
2 tsp vanilla

Preheat oven to 350F. Prepare 3 9" round cake pans with nonstick baking spray & flour. Cream together butter and shortening until light and fluffy. Slowly add sugar one cup at a time, making sure to fully incorporate each cup before adding the next. Cream for ~4 min or until light and fluff. Add eggs one at a time, same drill. Sift together flour, baking powder, and salt. Pour milks and vanilla into measuring cup and whisk together. Add liquid and dry to butter mixture alternating, ending with dry ingredients. Gently still until fully combined. Evenly distribute batter etween the three pansand place in oven. Bake for 25-30 min, or until a tester inserted into the middle comes out clean. Remove and allow to cool slightly in pans for ~5 min, then cool completely on wire rack. Frost as desired.

Notes: this recipe makes ~24 cupcakes, bake ~18 min. The tester can lie, so scoop out some in the middle to see - frosting will cover that anyways
