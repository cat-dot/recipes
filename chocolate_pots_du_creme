Chocolate-Blood Orange Pots du Creme

Candied Blood Orange:
1 c granulated sugar
1 c water
1 blood orange, sliced ⅛" thick

Preheat oven to 250Fand line a sheet pan with a silicone baking mat. In a medium saucepan, combine the sugar and water over medium-high heat. Bring to a boil and cook until the sugar dissolves, 1-2 min. Add the blood orange slices and reduce to a simmer; cook until the slices are translucent, 8-10 min. Using a slotted spatula, transfer the slices in a single layer to the prepared sheet pan. Bake until dried and crisp, 50-60 min. Let cool completely.

Pots:
1½ c (10 oz) bittersweet chocolate
1½ c whole milk
1½ c heavy cream
½ tbsp blood orange zest
½ c granulated sugar
1 tsp kosher salt
6 egg yolks

Place the chocolate in a blender and set aside. In a medium saucepan, bring the milk, cream and orange zest to a simmer over medium heat. Meanwhile, in a small bowl, whisk together the sugar, salt and egg yolks until the sugar has dissolved and the mixture is light yellow and thick. Whisk about 1 c of the simmering cream into the egg yolk mixture to temper, then add it all back into the pot. Cook, stirring constantly with a wooden spoon, until the custard is lightly thickened so it coats the back of the spoon, 5-6 min. Pour the custard over the chocolate in the blender and blend until smooth. Divide the mixture between five 8 oz ramekins, smoothing the tops with an offset spatula, then refrigerate until chilled and set, 2 hrs.

Marscapone:
½ c mascarpone
1 tbsp honey
1 tsp blood orange zest
½ tsp kosher salt

In a medium bowl, combine all the mascarpone ingredients. Whisk until the mixture holds a stiff peak.

Spoon a dollop of the whipped mascarpone over each pot de crème and stick a candied blood orange wheel about a third of the way into the surface, then serve.
