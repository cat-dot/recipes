In a large bowl, whisk together the flour, sugar, cinnamon, baking powder, baking soda, ginger, nutmeg, salt, allspice and clove. In a separate bowl, whisk together the pumpkin purée, heavy cream, milk, butter, eggs and vanilla extract until smooth. Stir the wet ingredients into the dry ingredients using a wooden spoon. Fold in the pecans. Heat a large nonstick skillet or griddle over medium heat. Add a tbsp of canola oil. Working in batches, pour ¼ c of the pancake batter into the skillet to form a 3" round disks.
