Preheat 12" cast iron skillet on stove top on high heat. Toss toamtoes with evoo and salt in a bowl, pour into heated skillet. Let tomatoes cook to the point of char, ~10 min. Stir in garlic, tomato paste, and pepper flakes; cook for ~30 s until fragrant. Turn off heat and mash tomatoes with potato masher. Add ziti and water to skillet and stir. Turn heat back to high until boiling, then turn heat down but keep skillet at vigorous simmer. Stir frequently, but cover with a lid when not stirring. Let cook for 10-15 min before checking pasta for doneness - looking for al dente. Turn off heat, stir in parmesan, pepper, and basil. Top with mozarella and put under broiler for 5 min, watching to make sure it doesn't burn. When cheese is melted & toasty, remove from oven and let cool at least 5-10 min before serving.
