  --Broccyourbody
  
Pasta & Sauce:
1 lb rigatoni
2 tbsp olive oil, divided
1 1 1/2 lbs sweet Italian chicken sausage, casings removed
1 shallot, diced
2 cloves garlic, minced
1 tbsp tomato paste
15-oz can pumpkin puree
1/2 c heavy cream
1 tsp salt, plus more to taste
1/4 tsp freshly ground black pepper
1/4 tsp red chili flakes
1/8 tsp ground nutmeg
1/2 c freshly grated parmesan cheese + more for topping
parsley, chopped, for topping

Cook pasta according to package directions. Reserve 1/2 c pasta water, then drain the pasta and set aside. While the pasta cooks, make the sauce: Heat 1 tbsp olive oil in a large skillet over medium heat. Add the sausage, break it up with a wooden spoon, and cook for ~5 min, stirring occasionally, until itâ€™s just cooked through. Remove the sausage from the pan. In the same skillet, heat the remaining 1 tbsp olive oil over medium heat. Add the shallots and garlic and cook for 2 min, stirring often, until the shallots begin to soften. Add the tomato paste and cook, stirring, for 1 min. Stir in the canned pumpkin, heavy cream, salt, pepper, nutmeg, chili flakes, and parmesan cheese. Let simmer for 2 min, then turn off the heat. Add the cooked pasta, cooked sausage, and 1/4 c pasta water to the pumpkin sauce and stir until well-coated. If needed, add more pasta water until the sauce is creamy and glossy. Taste and add more salt and pepper if desired. 

Topping:
3 tbsp butter
1 c walnuts, roughly chopped 
3 tbsp fresh sage, chopped
1/2 tsp kosher salt

To a small skillet over medium-low, add the butter. Cook, whisking often, for ~6-7 min until the butter has turned golden brown. Add the chopped walnuts and sage and cook for 5 min until toasted. Turn off the heat. Serve pasta in shallow bowls with the crispy walnut sage topping, more parmesan cheese, and a sprinkle of parsely on top. Enjoy!
