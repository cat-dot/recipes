Broccoli Bolognese
  --Adam Rapoport (and Molly Baz)

1 large head of broccoli (1 1/4 - 1 1/2 lbs) cut into florets, slak peeled and chopped into 1/2" pieces
kosher salt
2 tbsp evoo + more for drizzling
4 garlic cloves smashed
12 oz fresh italian sausage (~3 links) casings removed
crushed red pepper flakes
12 oz orecchiette
3 tbsp unsalted butter, cut into pieces
1 1/2 oz parmesan, finely grated (~1/2 c) + more for serving

Cook broccoli in a large pot of salted boiling water until crisp tender, ~3 min. Using slotted spoon, transfer broccoli to a colander and let cool, save pot of water for cooking pasta. Chop broccoli into small pieces, set aside. Heat 2 tbsp oil in a large skillet over medium. Cook garlic, shaking skillet occasionally, until it starts to turn golden, ~2 min. Transfer garlic to a small bowl. Cook sausage and a generous pinch of red pepper flakes, breaking up meat into smaller pieces with wooden spoon and stirring occasionally, until browned and cooked through, 6-8 min. Bring reserved pot of water to a boil and cook pasta until barely al dente, ~9 min (set timer for 3 min less than package instructions). Meanwhile, ladle ~1/2 c pasta water into skillet with sausage and add garlic and blanched broccoli. Keep mixture at a low simmer, stirring often, and mashing with a potato masher to break up sausage even more, until pasta is finished. Using a spider or slotted spoon, transfer pasta to skillet, then ladle in 1/2 c pasta water. Cook, stirring, until pasta absorbs most of the liquid and just al dente, ~4 min. Add butter and stir until melted, then transfer to a large bowl. Gradually add parmesan, tossing constantly, until you have a glossy, emulsified sauce. Serve with more parmesan, red pepper flakes, and a drizzle of oil.


Notes: Can scale up to 1 lb pasta & 1 lb sausage and as much broccoli as will fit. Also works with other sausages and can sub evoo for butter (or reduce butter)
