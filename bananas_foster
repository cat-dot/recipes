Bananas Foster

8 tbsp unsalted butter
1/2 c lightly packed brown sugar
3 tbsp orange juice
1 tsp ground cinnamon
pinch ground nutmeg
6 bananas, peeled and halved lengthwise, then crosswise
1/2 c dark rum
1 quart vanilla ice cream to serve

In a large skillet, heat the butter and brown sugar over high heat, stirring often, until they have melted into a caramel, 2 min. Reduce the heat to medium high and cook, stirring constantly, until the sugar is completely melted and the butter starts to smell nutty, 3 min. Stir in the orange juice, cinnamon, and nutmeg, then add the bananas. Continue to cook, genrtly stirring the bananas and spooning sauce over them to coat, 3 min more. Remove the pan from the heat, and holding the skillet away from you, carefully add the rum. Using a kitchen torch or match, carefully light the rum mixture on fire, burning off the alcohol. Serve immediately in individual bowls, spooning the sauce over the bananas and top with a scoop of vanilla ice cream.
