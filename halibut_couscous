Turn on the broiler and place the rack in the center of the oven. Pat the halibut fillets dry with paper towels and season with salt and pepper, then rub 1 tbsp of oilive oil on each. Drop 1 tbsp of dukkah for each fillet 2" apart on a parchment lined baking sheet. Spread out the mix so it's about as big as each fillet.
