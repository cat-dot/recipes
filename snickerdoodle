Snickerdoodle

1 1/2 c ap flour
1 tsp baking soda
1 tsp cream of tartar
1/2 c (1 stick) cold unsalted butter, cut into 1/2" pieces
1/4 tsp kosher salt
1 c sugar, divided
1 large egg, room temperature
2 tsp ground cinnamon

Whisk flour, baking soda, and cream of tartar in a medium bowl. Using an electric mixer on medium speed, beat butter in a large bowl until pale yellow, 2–3 min. Scrape down sides, add salt and 3/4 c sugar, and continue to beat until light and fluffy, 3–4 min more. Reduce mixer speed to low and gradually add dry ingredients, beating until just incorporated. Gather dough into a ball, wrap ball in plastic wrap, and chill until firm, about 30 min. Preheat oven to 375°F. Mix cinnamon and remaining 1/4 c sugar in a small bowl. Using your hands, roll tablespoonfuls of dough into balls. Roll balls in cinnamon sugar, then transfer to prepared sheets, spacing about 2" apart. Bake cookies, rotating sheets halfway through, until just golden brown around the edges, 8–10 min.
