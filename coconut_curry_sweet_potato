1 large sweet potato, peeled and diced
2 red bell peppers, seeded and chopped
1/2 white onion, chopped
14 oz can coconut milk
1/2 c chicken broth
1 1/2 tsp curry powder
1 1/2 tsp garam masala
1/2 tsp garlic salt
salt and pepper to taste

Whisk coconut milk, broth, and seasonings together in a bowl and pour into a 6 qt slow cooker. Place diced sweet potato, bell peppers, onion, and chicken in the slow cooker. Cook on low for 4-6 hrs or high for 3-4 hrs. Remove chicken and shred with a fork. Add back into the cooker. Serve over warm rice.
