Bulgogi Burger

Sauce:
1 1/2 tbsp (20ml) gochujang (spicy Korean red pepper paste)
3 large cloves garlic, grated or minced
1 tbsp grated peeled fresh ginger (from about one 2" knob)
1 tbsp (15ml) rice wine vinegar
1/4 c (50g) brown sugar
2 tsp (10ml) toasted sesame oil

In a small saucepan, mix soy sauce, gochujang, garlic, ginger, vinegar, and brown sugar together. Bring mixture to a boil over medium-high heat, reduce to a simmer, and cook until thickened enough to coat a spoon, 5-7 min.  Remove from heat, add sesame oil and let cool. Use immediately or refrigerate in an airtight container for up to 1 week.

Kimchi Mayo:
1 c (215g) mayonnaise
2 tbsp (30ml) kimchi brine
1/2 c finely diced drained kimchi (100g)
1 tsp (4g) sugar
1 tbsp (15ml) toasted sesame oil
1 small clove garlic, grated or minced
2 scallions, white and light green parts only, finely chopped (about 40g)

 In a medium mixing bowl, stir together mayonnaise, kimchi brine, kimchi, sugar, sesame oil, garlic, and scallions until well combined. Refrigerate until ready to use.

Danmuji:
1 1/2 c (355ml) water
1 1/2 c (355ml) unseasoned rice vinegar
1/2 c (100g) sugar
1 tbsp (15g) kosher salt
2 medium cloves garlic, halved lengthwise
1 tsp turmeric powder
15 whole black peppercorns
2 bay leaves
1 lb (450g) daikon radish, peeled and cut into thin rounds

In a medium saucepan, stir together water, vinegar, sugar, salt, garlic, turmeric, peppercorns, and bay leaves. Bring to a boil over medium-high heat, stirring to ensure that sugar fully dissolves. Remove from heat and add daikon. Press a paper towel directly against the surface of the brine and let cool to room temperature, 1-2 hrs. Transfer pickles and brine to an airtight glass container and store in the refrigerator. (The turmeric will stain a plastic container yellow.) Pickles will last about 1 month.

Burgers:
1 1/2 lbs (680g) fresh ground beef chuck (about 80% lean)
Kosher salt
Vegetable oil, for oiling the grill
2 tbsp (10g) toasted sesame seeds
4 sesame seed buns, split
2 c (about 200g) finely shredded quartered and cored red cabbage
danmuji

Form beef into 4 patties, about 1/2" wider than the burger buns. Using your thumb, press a depression into the center of each patty to prevent bulging during cooking. Cook using preferred method. When patties are well charred and the centers register 110°F on an instant-read thermometer, brush each with the bulgogi sauce on both sides. Continue cooking burgers, flipping and brushing with sauce occasionally, until they register 120°F for medium-rare or 130°F for medium. Remove patties from grill and brush with more sauce on both sides until well glazed and coated. Sprinkle all over with sesame seeds and let rest 5 min. Meanwhile, toast burger buns over moderate heat on grill until light golden brown. Spread bottom and top buns with kimchi mayonnaise. Layer bottom buns with half the cabbage followed by the danmuji, and patties. Brush top side of patties once more with bulgogi sauce, then top with remaining cabbage, close top buns, and serve.
