Caramel bits:
sugar

Caramelize sugar and pour out onto some parchment to cool, spreading evenly. Smash into bits, nothing larger than a grain of rice.

225 g bread flour
2 g baking powder
1 g baking soda
9 g koser salt
50 g glucose syrup (can use light corn syrup)
2 eggs
1 1/2 sticks unsalted butter, room temp
300 g granulated sugar
260 g creamy peanut butter
1/5 g vanilla
caramel bits
4-6 g chocolate chips or chopped chocolate

Combine dry ingredients in a medium bowl and set aside. In the bowl of a stand mixer, add butter, sugar, and glucose syrup and beat until fluffy, 2-3 min. Scrape sides of bowl down and add peanut butter, beat for ~30 s or until just combined. With the mixer on low, add eggs until just combined, then add vanilla and continue beating on high speed for 3 min, or until light in color and double in volume. Scrape bowl down, add dry ingredients and mix on low until just combined. Add caramel bits and chocolate, slowly mix to combine. Portion out dough onto parchment lined sheet, making "chubby little discs". Wrap in plastic wrap and refrigerate min 3 hrs, up to 3 days (the longer the better). Bake in 375F oven for 15-18 min. Cool completely before trying to remove from parchment.
