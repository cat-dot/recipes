  --Kristin Rosenau

1 c unsweetened shredded coconut, lightly packed
3 tbsp coconut oil
2 tbsp honey (or pure maple syrup)
1 tsp vanilla
pinch of salt
12 (+) whole almonds
4 oz semi-sweet chocolate, chopped

n a food processor, process the shredded coconut, coconut oil, honey, vanilla, and salt until it forms a thick paste, ~2-3 min. Test the coconut to see if it holds together by squeezing it in your palm. If the coconut is still too loose, continue to process for 1-2 more min. Drop the coconut mixture by the tablespoon onto a non-stick baking mat or parchment paper. Form each ball into a small rectangle by pressing it into formation. Press an almond on top of the coconut rectangles. Freeze the coconut for 15-30 min, or until solid. Drop the coconut mixture by the tablespoon onto a non-stick baking mat or parchment paper.

Melt the chopped chocolate in the microwave, stirring between each increment until the chocolate is smooth. Skewer each bar onto a toothpick and dip into the melted chocolate, tapping off any excess. Wait for the chocolate to dry before removing from the toothpick. Serve immediately or store at room temp for several days.
