Cherry Clafouti
  --America's Test Kitchen

1 1/2 lb fresh cherries, pitted and halved
1 tsp lemon juice
2 tsp + 1/2 c ap flour, divided
1/8 tsp cinnamon
4 large eggs
2/3 c (4 2/3 oz) + 2 tsp sugar
2 1/2 tsp vanilla
1/4 tsp salt
1 c heavy cream
2/3 c whole milk
1 tbsp unsalted butter

Adjust oven racks to low and middle position; place 12" skillet on lower rack and heat to 425F. Line rimmed baking sheet with foil and place cherries, cut side up, on sheet. Roast cherries on upper rack until just tender and cut sides look dry, ~15 min. Transfer cherries to medium bowl, toss with lemon juice, and let cool for 5 min. Combine 2 tsp flour with cinnamon  in small bowl; dust cherries evenly with flour mixture and toss to coat thoroughly. Whisk eggs, 2/3 c sugar, vanilla, and salt in large bowl until smooth and pale, ~1 min. Whisk in remaining 1/2 c flour until smooth. Whisk in cream and milk until incorporated. Remove skillet (skillet handle will be hot) from oven and set on wire rack. Add butter and swirl to coat bottom and sides of skillet (butter will melt and brown quickly). Pour batter into skillet and arrange cherries evenly on top (some will sink). Transfer skillet to lower rack and bake until clafouti puffs and turns golden brown (edges will be dark brown) and center registers 195F, 18-22 min, rotating skillet halfway through baking. Transfer skillet to wire rack and let cool for 25 min. Sprinkle clafouti evenly with remaining 2 tsp sugar. Slice into wedges and serve.


Notes: Do not substitute frozen cherries for fresh
