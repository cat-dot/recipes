Alu Banda (cheesy potato balls)
  --Chetna Makan
  
Filling:
2 potatoes, such as Maris Piper, Desiree, or Yukon Gold, peeled and cut into 1/2" pieces
1 tbsp sunflower oil + extra for deep-frying
1 green chile, finely chopped
10 fresh curry leaves, finely chopped
1/2 tsp black mustard seeds
1/2 tsp salt
1/2 tsp chili powder
1/2 tsp ground turmeric
30 g (1 oz) cheddar cheese, cut into small cubes

Put the potato pieces in a pan and cover with water. Bring to a boil and cook for 5 min until tender. Drain and set aside. Heat the 1 tbsp of oil in a pan and add the green chile, curry leaves, and mustard seeds. Once they start to sizzle, stir in the salt and ground spices and cook over a low heat for a few seconds. Add 1 tbsp of water and the cooked potatoes and mix well, then leave to cool while you make the batter.

Batter:
100 g (3 1/2 oz) gram flour (besan/chickpea flour)
1/2 tsp salt
1/2 tsp chili powder
1/2 tsp ground turmeric

Mix together all the batter ingredients in a bowl. Then gradually whisk in ~1/2 c of water to make a smooth batter with a coating consistency. Divide the potato mixture into 8 portions and form each into a ball about the size of a lime. Push a cube of cheese into the center of each potato ball and mold the potato mixture back around it to seal it in. Heat enough oil for deep-frying in a deep-fat fryer or deep, heavy-based pan (ensuring the pan is no more than 1/3 full) to 350F (180C). Line a plate with paper towels. Dip one potato ball at a time into the batter and then carefully add to the hot oil. Deep-fry in small batches for a min on each side, until golden. Transfer to the paper-lined plate to absorb the excess oil while you fry the remaining balls. Serve warm.
