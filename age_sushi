Notes: This is mostly as written from my grandmother with a little more wording from me. I would assume the rice bit should have rice, and that you mix the seasoning in but no amount listed, assuming a full rice cooker's worth (standard rice cooker, not industrial). She would scrape out a bit from each age half before stuffing with rice, filling enough so that the rice was level with the edge of the age. These were often referred to as footballs in our family. I'm sure if you're sensitive to it you can leave out the msg.
