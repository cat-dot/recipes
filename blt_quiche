BLT Quiche
  --Erin Jean McDowell

1 3/4 c (~210 g) cheese cracker crumbs (I used about 194 Cheez-Its)
6 tbsp (85 g) unsalted butter, melted
1 packed c (100 g) finely grated Parmesan, divided
12 oz (340 g) chopped thick-cut bacon
1/2 medium (~100 g) red onion, thinly sliced
2 c (~290 g) cherry tomatoes
2 c (~60 g) arugula
6 large eggs (340 g)
1/3 c (80 g) whole milk
1/4 c (60 g) heavy cream
1/2 tsp (3 g) kosher salt
1/2 tsp (2 g) freshly ground black pepper
1/2 c packed (50 g) shredded Gruyère or white cheddar cheese

Arrange a rack in the center of the oven; heat the oven to 350F/175C. In a medium bowl, stir the crumbs and butter to combine. The crust should easily hold together in clumps when you press it together between your fingers (if it doesn’t, melt a little more butter and add it 1 tbsp/15 g at a time until it comes together). Press evenly into the base and up the sides of an ungreased 9"/23 cm pie plate. Bake the crust for 10-12 min, until lightly browned at the edges and toasty smelling. Let cool completely. Increase the oven temperature to 375F/190C. Place the cooled crust on a baking sheet. Spread 1/2 c/56 g of the Parmesan on the base of the crust in an even layer. In a large skillet over medium heat, cook the bacon, stirring occasionally, until very crisp. Using a slotted spoon, transfer to a plate. Drain all but 1 tbsp/15 g of the fat. Cook the onion and tomatoes, stirring occasionally, for 5-6 min, until the onions are translucent and the tomatoes burst. Add the arugula in batches, stirring until the greens wilt. Let cool, then transfer to the prepared crust. In a medium bowl, whisk the eggs, milk, cream, salt, and pepper until well combined. Gently pour the custard over the vegetables. Sprinkle the Gruyère and the remaining 1/2 c/56 g of the Parmesan over the surface of the quiche. Bake the quiche for 30-35 min, until the custard appears set around the edge, but is still slightly jiggly in the center. If desired, turn on the broiler to give the top layer more of a crust (broil for 1-3 min). Let cool for at least 15 min before slicing and serving warm, or let cool completely before serving.
