Tonkotsu Broth
  --Binging with Babish

4 lbs pigs trotters, cut into 1" discs 
water
1 onion, cut into quarters
bunch of scallions, roughly chopped
fresh ginger, chopped

Place trotters in large stock pot and cover with cold water. Bring to a boil. Once nasty, grey stoff floats to the surface, take off heat and strain, keeping trotters and dumping the water (Can also scrape any grey nasty off the trotters at this point). Rinse the pot and place the trotters back into it, covering them again with cold water, and bring to a rolling simmer. While that is coming to temp, place the onions, scallions, and ginger in a skillet over high heat; cook until you get a nice char on everything. Put the aromatics in with the trotters and cook at rolling simmer for 12 hrs. Strain the broth and let cool. Chill completely if freezing, or place in the refrigerator until ready to use.
