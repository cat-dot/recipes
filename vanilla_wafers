Vanilla Wafers
  --Baking a Moment

1/2 c unsalted butter (1 stick), softened
1/2 c powdered sugar
1/4 c sugar
1/4 c milk
1 1/2 tsp vanilla
1 1/4 c ap flour
1/2 tsp kosher salt

Preheat oven to 350F and line baking sheets with parchment paper. Place the butter, powdered sugar, and granulated sugar in a large mixing bowl, and beat on medium speed until pale and fluffy, 3-5 min. Scrape the bottom and sides of the bowl with a silicone spatula, then mix in the milk and vanilla until combined. Stir in the flour and salt, taking care not to overwork the dough. Transfer the dough to a pastry bag fitted with a 1A tip.  Pipe 1" diameter circles onto the prepared baking sheets, leaving room for spread. Bake 20-24 min or until golden brown on the bottoms and around the edges. Cool completely. Stor in air tight container.


Notes: Probably want to up vanilla and/or use vanilla sugar. For mini cheesecakes, diameter closer to 2"
