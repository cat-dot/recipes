Stir 5 c hot broth mixture into rice; reduce heat to medium-low, cover, and simmer until almost all liquid has been absorbed and rice is just al dente, 16-19 min, stirring twice during cooking. Add 3/4 c hot broth mixture and stir gently and constantly until risotto becomes creamy, ~3 min. Stir in parmesan. Remove pot from heat, cover, and let stand 5 min.
