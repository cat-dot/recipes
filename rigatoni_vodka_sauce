  --Claire Saffitz

kosher salt
1 medium onion, chopped
4 garlic cloves, minced
4 oz parmesan cheese, grated
2 tbsp evoo + more for drizzling
4.5 oz tomato paste
1/2 tsp crushed red pepper flakes
2 oz vodka
3/4 c heavy cream
1 lb rigatoni
basil leaves (for garnish)

Fill large pot with water and bring to a boil on high heat; add salt. Heat evoo in a dutch oven over medium. Add onion and garlic and cook, stirring constantly, until onion just starts to brown around the edges, 5-7 min. Add tomato paste and red pepper flakes and stir until paste evenly coats onion. Continue to cook, stirring often, until paste is deep red and starting to brown, 5-7 min. Add vodka to deglaze pan and stir to incorporate, scraping up fond. Reduce heat to low. Using heatproof glass measuring cup, scoop 1/4 c hot water from pot (before you salt it), then ad 3/4 c cream - this brings temp of cream up so it won't break when adding to pot. Slowly add warm cream to dutch oven, stirring constantly, until a smooth sauce forms. Remove from heat. Add rigatoni to boiling, salted water and cook according to package instructions until al dente. About 1 min before timer goes off, scoop 1 c pasta water and set aside. Put ducth oven back on low heat. Transfer pasta to dutch oven using spider (or something similar), excess water is fine. Stir to incorporate pasta and sauce, adding reserved water as needed. Gradually add half the cheese, stirring constantly to melt cheese. You should have a smooth, glossy sauce that coats each piece of pasta. Add more pasta water as needed to thin sauce. Season with salt and pepper to taste. Serve, topping with remaining cheese, a drizzle of evoo, and torn fresh basil leaves.
