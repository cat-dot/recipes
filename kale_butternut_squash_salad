Kale and Butternut Squash Salad

1 small (1 1/2lbs) butternut squash - peeled, seeded, and cut into 1" pieces
5 tbsp pink salt (himalayan) divided, + more to taste
3/4 c (1/2 can) cooked chickpeas, rinsed and patted dry
1/2 c canola oil
1 shallot, thinly sliced
2 tsp freshly squeezed lemon juice + more to taste (1/2 lemon)
3 packed cups lacinato kale leaves, torn into bite sized pieces
2 fuyu persimmons, peeled
3 tbsp dried mulberries (can sub golden raisins)
3 tbsp roasted pumpkin seeds

Preheat oven to 400F. Line a baking sheet with parchment paper and add the squash pieces in a single layer. Season with 2 1/2 tbsp of olive oil and 1/4 tsp salt, tossing to evenly coat. Spread in an even layer and roast until tender and golden brown, 30-40 min. Line a separate baking sheet with parchment paper and add the chickpeas. Season with 1 tbsp olive oil and 1/2 tsp salt, tossing evenly to coat. Roast, shaking the pan every 10 min, until the chickpeas are crispy and split open, 30-40 min. Heat the oil in a large saute pan over medium high heat. Add the shallots and fry, stirring with a slotted spoon, until they turn deep golden brown, 15 min. Lower the heat to medium if the shallots darken quickly before getting crispy. Transfer to a paper towel lined plate and immediately season with salt. Dress the kale 10 min before serving. In a large bowl, add 2 tsp of lemon juice, 1 1/2 tsp olive oil, and a pinch of salt. Add the kale and toss with your hands, massaging to tenderize. Roughly dice one persimmon and slice the other into 1/4" rounds. Line a large serving plate with the dressed kael. Lay the persimmon rounds in the center and surround with the squash, chickpeas, diced persimmons, dried mulberries, and pumpkin seeds. Top with the crispy shallots and serve
