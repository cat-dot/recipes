4 tbsp unsalted butter, divided
1 large onion, chopped fine
salt and pepper
3/4 tsp ground coriander
1/2 tsp cumin
1/4 tsp ground ginger
1/8 tsp cinnamon

Melt 2 tbsp butter in large saucepan over medium heat. Add onion and 1 tsp salt and cook, stirring occasionally, until softened but not browned, ~5 min. Add coriander, cumin, ginger, cinnamon, cayenne, and 1/4 tsp pepper and cook until fragrant, ~2 min. Stir in tomator paste and garlic and cook for 1 min.
