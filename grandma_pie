  --Ananda Eidelstein

Dough:
1 tablespoon olive oil, plus more for brushing
1 3/4 c warm water (~110Â°F)
2 1/4 tsp active dry yeast (from a 1/4 oz. envelope)
4 1/2 c ap flour, spooned and leveled, plus more for work surface
4 tsp kosher salt
1 tbsp granulated sugar

Brush a large bowl with oil; set aside. Whisk water and yeast in a large bowl. Let stand for 10 min. Mix in oil. To mix dough with mixer: Place yeast mixture in the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with the dough hook. With mixer on low, gradually add flour, salt, and sugar; mix until no dry spots remain, ~2 min. Increase speed to medium; mix until dough makes a slapping sound against bowl and starts to climb up hook, ~5 min.To mix dough by hand: Add flour, salt, and sugar to yeast mixture, stirring with a rubber spatula until incorporated. Transfer dough to a lightly floured surface and knead, flouring surface as needed, until smooth but slightly sticky, ~10 min. Transfer dough to oiled bowl and turn to coat. Cover loosely with plastic wrap and place in a warm, draft-free area (on top of the refrigerator or in an off oven). Let rest until doubled in size, 1-1 1/2 hr. Gently punch down dough.

2 tbsp olive oil
1 c crushed tomatoes
2 tbsp heavy cream
1 clove garlic, grated
1/2 tsp dried oregano + more for serving
1/2 tsp kosher salt
12 oz part-skim mozzarella cheese, shredded (~3 c)
3 oz sliced pepperoni (3/4 cup)
1 red onion, thinly sliced into rounds
