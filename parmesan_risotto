Parmesan Risotto

8 c chicken stock
3 thyme sprigs
3 bay leaves
4" rosemary sprig
3" Parmesan rind
3 tbsp olive oil
2 garlic cloves, minced
1 small yellow onion, minced
2 c carnaroli rice
1 c dry white wine
1½ c grated Parmesan cheese + more for garnish
2 tbsp unsalted butter
1 tbsp lemon juice
1 tsp lemon zest
Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper to taste

In a large pot, combine the chicken stock, thyme sprigs, bay leaves, rosemary sprig and Parmesan rind, and bring to a light simmer. in a 4½-quart Dutch oven, heat the olive oil over medium heat. Add the garlic and onions, and sweat until translucent, 6 to 8 min. Add the rice and cook, stirring constantly until lightly toasted and fragrant, 2 min. Stir in the wine and cook until fully absorbed, 1 to 2 min. Using a ladle, add about 1½ c of the simmering stock, making sure not to add any of the herbs or cheese rind. Cook, stirring constantly until the liquid is completely absorbed, 5 to 6 min. Continue this process of adding stock in these increments and stirring, until you have used up all of the stock and the rice is cooked, 25 min. Remove from the heat and stir in the Parmesan, butter, lemon juice and zest. Stir until incorporated, then season with salt and pepper. Garnish with more parmesan when serving.

Notes: Pull out a grain of rice and, using your finger, press it down on a cutting board. This should reveal smaller white dots of starch in the rice. If you see three visible dots, your risotto is not done cooking. However, once you see two specs, you can take the pot off the stove.
