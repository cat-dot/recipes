Mapo Pork Lo Mein

Marinade:
1 lb ground pork
1 1/2 tbsp granulated sugar
1 tbsp fish sauce
1 tbsp maggi seasoning (or shoyu)
1/2 tsp baking soda
7 garlic cloves, minced

In a medium bowl, combine all the ingredients and mix thoroughly.

Lo Mein:
4 garlic cloves, minced
1 fresno chile, stemmed, seeded, and minced
1" ginger, peeled and minced
3 tbsp soybean oil
7 tbsp chili bean paste
2 tbsp sweet bean sauce
1 1/2 c chicken stock, divided
3/4 c spicy chili crisp (lao gan ma)
2 tsp cornstarch
1 lb fresh low mein noodles

In a mini food processor, chop the garlic, chile, and ginger into a fine paste. In a medium saucepan, heat the oil over medium high heat. Add the paste and fry until fragrant, 1 min. Add the chili bean paste and sweet bean sauce to the pan and cook, stirring often, until the oil in the mixture begins to split, 2-3 min. Add the marinated pork to the pan and cook, breaking apart the mixture with a wooden spoon, until the meat begins to caramelize, 4-5 min. Stir in all but 1 tbsp of the stock, scraping up any fond that forms on the bottom of the pan. Bring to a boil, then stir in the spicy chili crisp. In a separate bowl, combine the remaining tbsp of stock with the cornstarch and mix until smooth. Add to the pot, making sure that the liquid is boiling, and stir until slightly thickened, 2 min. Remove from the heat and keep warm. Bring a large pot of water to a boil. Add the lo mein noodles and cook until tender, 4 min. Strain the noodles and divide between plates. Spoon the pork mixture over the noodles, then serve.
