Hot Pepper Jelly

1 c apple cider vinegar
4 jalapenos, seeded and finely chopped
3 poblano peppers, seeded and finely chopped
1 red bell pepper, seeded and finely chopped
3 c sugar
1 tsp kosher salt
1 tbsp pectin

In a blender, combine the vinegar and peppers, and pulse until the peppers are finely chopped, speckled through the liquid. Transfer to a medium saucepan and add the sugar and salt. Bring to a boil over medium high heat and let cook until the sugar fully dissolves, 5 min. Sprinkle the pectin over the mixture and continue to cook until fully incorporated, 1-2 min. Divide the jelly between 2 mason jars, pressing the mixture down until there is only about 1/2" of space left at the top of each jar. Wipe the rim then affix the lid on each jar. Bring a stockpot filled with enough water for the jars to be completely submerged to a boil. Arrange the jars on a wire rack and lover into the water. Boil for ~15 min. Carefully remove the jars and let them cool to room temp on a folded towel, making sure not to disturb the lids. Check the seal after 24hrs; it should not flex when pressed in the center. The jelly will keep for up to 1 yr.
