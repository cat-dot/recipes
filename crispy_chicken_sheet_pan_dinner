Preheat the oven to 400F. Place the potatoes, salt, pepper and butter on a sheet of foil. Wrap the foil around the potatoes and close off any openings. Place the pocket of potatoes in the oven while you prep the remaining dinner.
In one bowl, mix the flour, salt, pepper and 1 tbsp of the Italian seasoning. In another bowl, whisk 3 eggs together. In a third bowl mix the panko, parmesan and remaining tbsp of the Italian seasoning. Take one chicken strip and place in the flour mixture, then the egg mixture, then the panko mixture making sure the chicken is completely coated. 
Place the chicken on one end of a baking sheet. Add the brussels sprouts in the center and place the strips of bacon directly on top. Remove the potatoes from the oven and place at the end of the baking sheet. Place in the oven for 20 min then remove and flip the chicken. Place back in the oven to cook for another 15 min until browned. Remove from the oven. Check to see if the potatoes are softened, if not place the pouch back in the oven to cook 5-10 more min until finished. Remove the bacon and slice into bite sized pieces. Put the potatoes in a bowl with the half and half and beat into mashed potatoes. Serve all together topping with the bacon and a drizzle of balsamic glaze. Enjoy!
