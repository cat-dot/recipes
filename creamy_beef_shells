Creamy Beef and Shells
  --Meghan Splawn

1 tbsp olive oil
1 lb lean ground beef
1 tsp kosher salt
1 tsp garlic powder
1 tsp onion power
2 c beef broth
8 oz dried pasta shells
15 oz can tomato sauce
8 oz sharp white cheddar cheese, shredded (~2 c)
1/2 c heavy cream or half-and-half

Heat olive oil in a large skillet over medium heat until shimmering. Add lean ground beef and cook until cooked through and browned. Season with kosher salt, garlic powder, and 1 teaspoon onion powder, and cook until fragrant, ~1 min more. Stir in beef broth, dried pasta shells, and tomato sauce. Cover and cook until the shells are tender and the sauce is slightly thickened, 8-10 min. Meanwhile, shred sharp white cheddar cheese. Remove from the heat and stir in heavy cream or half-and-half and cheese until the cheese is melted.



Notes: most cheeses will work if you don't have sharp white cheddar.
