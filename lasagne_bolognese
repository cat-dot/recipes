Lasagne Bolognese

Bechamel
4 tbsp unsalted butter
1/4 c ap flour
4 c whole milk, warmed
salt and white pepper to taste
pinch of freshly grated ground nutmeg

Melt the butter in a small saucepan over medium heat. Right when the butter begins to foam, add the flour and cook, whisking until the roux turns light golden brown and starts to smell nutty, 4-6 min. Pour in the milk, 1 c at a time, and bring to boil. Reduce the heat and simmer, whisking often so that the bottom doesn't scortch, until the sauce thickens, 12-15 min. Turn off the heat and season with salt, white pepper, and nutmeg.

Ragu:
2 ribs celery, roughly chopped
2 medium carrots, roughly chopped
1 medium yellow onion, roughly chopped
3 tbsp evoo
4 oz pancetta, finely diced
salt and pepper to taste
2 lbs sweet italian sausage, casings removed
2 fresh bay leaves
2 sprigs thyme
1 c dry white wine
3 tbsp tomato paste
3 c chicken or beef stock (homemade preferred) low sodium, divided
1 c whole milk, divided

In a food processor, combine the celery, carrots, and onions and pulse until finely chopped. In a large, heavy-bottomed pot over medium heat, add 2 tbsp of the olive oil. When the oil is hot, add the pancetta and cook, stirring until some of the fat has rendered, about 5 min. Add the chopped vegetables and season with salt. Cook, stirring constantly until the vegetables are very soft and all the liquid has evaporated, 15-20 min. Transfer mixture to a bowl and set aside. Return the pot to the stove over medium high heat and add the remaining olive oil. Using a wooden spoon, break the sausage into small clumps. Season it with salt and brown, 15-20 min. Return the reserved vegetable mixture to the pot with the bay leaf and thyme and cook, stirring often, until most of the liquid has evaporated, 10 min. Deglaze the pan by adding the wine, making sure to scrape the brown bits on the bottom of the pan; reduce until all the liquid has evaporated and the contents have taken on a rich chestnut color, 15-20 min. Add the tomato paste and cook for 3-4 min. Deglaze the pan with 1/2 c of the stock and 1/2 c of the milk and reduce by half, ~ 15 min. Add the remaining stock and milk, skimming any fat that rises to the surface, and continue cooking until the flavors have melded together and the sauce has thickened, 30-40 min. Season with salt and allow to cool. Remove and discard the bay leaf and thyme. The sauce can be made up to 3 days ahead. Allowing the sauce to cool completely then slowly reheating until just warmed through will give the sauce a deep richer flavor.

Lasagne:
1 lb lasagne noodles, cooked until very al dente, and drained 
unsalted butter for greasing the dish
1 c finely grated parmesan

Preheat the oven to 350F. Reheast the sauces to warm if they were made ahead. Grease a 9x13" baking dish. Spread 1/2 c of the bechamel sauce in the bottom of prepared dish; top with 1/4 of the noodles. Top the noodles with 3/4 c bolognese sauce, followed by 1/4 c bechamel and 1/3 c of the cheese. Repeat the process 3 times. Reserve any extra meat sauce for another use. Transfer the baking dish to a sheet tray and bake until the cheese becomes brown and bubbly, 40-45 min. Remove from the oven and allow the lasagne to cool for 30 min before serving.
