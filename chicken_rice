NYC Street Cart Style Chicken & Rice
by Kenji Lopez-Alt

Sauce:
1 c plain yogurt
1 tsp apple cider vinegar (or white)
1 lemon, juiced
1/2 tsp sugar
1/2 tsp salt

Whisk together all sauce ingredients in a small bowl. Refrigerate until ready to use.

Chicken:
2 lbs boneless, skinless chicken thighs
1 lemon, juiced
1 tsp dried oregano
2 tsp ground coriander
1 1/2 tsp salt
1/4 tsp black pepper
4 cloves garlic, minced
1/4 c olive oil

Toss chicken with other ingredients. Marinate at least 15 min, an hour is ideal. Heat large pot over high heat and add enough oil to coat the bottom lightly. Cook chicken in batches until done. Set aside and keep warm. 

Rice:
2 tbsp butter
1 1/2 tsp ground tumeric
1 tsp ground cumin
2 c basmati or long grain white rice
2 c chicken stock
1/2 tsp salt

In the same pot used for chicken, add butter, tumeric, and cumin. Stir until butter melts and spices bloom. Stir in rice, cook about 1-2 min. Add stock and salt and bring to a boil. Turn heat down to low, cover, and cook 15 min. Fluff with a fork when finished and remove from heat.

When everything is done, dice chicken. Serve chicken pieces on top of rice, drizzle with the white sauce and add hot sauce if desired.
