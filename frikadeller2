Frikadeller (Danish Meatballs)
  --Erica Walker

Balls:
3/4 lb ground beef (or ground veal is even more authentic)
1 lb ground pork
1 onion large, grated
1/2 c breadcrumbs
4 tbsp flour
2 eggs
1/2 tsp salt
1/4 tsp pepper
1/4 tsp nutmeg
2-3 cloves of garlic
1/2 tsp sage leaves
half & half or milk for consistency (1/4-1/2 c)
butter (for frying)

Combine beef, pork and onion. Add breadcrumbs, flour, eggs, salt, pepper, nutmeg, garlic, and sage leaves. It works best if you mix it with your hands. Slowly add half & half for consistency. You want the mixture to be slightly sticky, you shouldn't be able to form them into a perfect ball. Coat large skillet well with butter. Drop clumps of mixture (a heaping tbsp-size) onto the skillet. Fry on medium to medium-low heat until browned. Press the meat down a lightly with a fork so it flattens out a little. It should look like a small, but fat hamburger, Flip and brown on the other side, ~3-5 min. Add more butter with each batch. Serve with gravy and Rødkål

Gravy:
3/4 – 2 tbsp drippings from Frickadeller
butter if needed
3 tbsp flour
1 cup heavy cream milk works too
1 tbsp beef bouillon
salt & pepper

Remove meatballs from the skillet, and use the same skillet to make the gravy using the brown bits and drippings from the meatballs. Add the flour to the drippings to form a roux. Add butter if needed. Slowly add cream or milk until mixture reaches gravy consistency. Add beef bouillon, salt & pepper to taste.


Notes: more traditional is using veal for beef and no spices (nutmeg, garlic, sage)
