Creamy Spinach Avo-Artichoke Dip

4 garlic cloves, minced
1 tbsp olive oil
12 oz fresh spinach, chopped
1 1/2 c frozen artichokes, thawed and chopped
4 oz cream cheese
1 ripe avocado
1/2 tsp salt
1/2 tsp pepper
1/4 tsp crushed red pepper flakes (optional)
1/2 c grated parmesan cheese divided

Preheat oven to 375F. Saute garlic in olive oil over medium heat for ~1 min. Add the spinach and artichokes, saute for 5 min; remove from heat. In a medium bowl, combine the cream cheese, avocado, salt, pepper, and crushed red pepper; mix until smooth. Stir in 1/4 c of parmesan, gruyere, and the spinach mixture. Spoon mixture into an oven-safe 2 quart greased dish; sprinkle the remaining 1/4 c parmesan over the top. Bake for 15 min or until bubbly.
