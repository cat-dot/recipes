Kimchi Fired Rice

8 oz slab bacon, roughly chopped
2 garlic cloves, minced
1 medium onion, finely chopped
1" piece ginger, peeled and minced
2 c cooked long grain white rice (day old is best)
1 1/2 c chopped napa cabbage kimchi
kosher salt to taste
2 tbsp butter, softened
1 tbsp gochujang
4 eggs, sunny-side up for serving
thinly sliced scallions for garnish

In a large wok cook the bacon over medium high heat until the fat has rendered and the bacon is crisp, 8 min. Add the garlic, onion, and ginger, and cook until aromatic, 1-2 min. Add the rice and kimchi, and cook, tossing frrequently until heated through, 4-5 min. Season with salt. Reduce the heat to medium low and flatten the rice with your spatula. Cook until the rice forms a crust on the bottom of the pan, 4-5 min. In a small bowl, mix together the butter and gochujang until smooth. Spoon the gochujang butter over the rice and top with fired eggs and sliced scallions and serve.
