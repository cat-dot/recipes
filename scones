Scones

2 3/4 c flour
1/4 c butter, cold & cubed
1/4 c sugar
5 tsp baking powder
60 ml milk
1/4 c raisins
2 eggs
lemon zest from 1/2 lemon

Preheat oven to 400F. Add  butter, flour, baking powder, zest, and sugar into the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with the paddle attachment. Mix until the mixture resembles fine breadcrumbs. With the machine running, add the milk and eggs. Mix until they form a dough, being careful not to overwork, then add the raisins. Place the dough onto a floured work suface and roll out to a thickness of 1". Dip a 2 1/4" round pastry cutter in flour, then cut out the scones and place on a baking sheet. Allow to rest for 5 min, then bake for 5 min, then turn the temp down to 350F and bake for another 5-10 min. Let cool on a rack before serving.
