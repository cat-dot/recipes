Crepes
  --America's Test Kitchen

1/2 tsp vegetable oil
1 c (5 oz) ap flour
1 tsp sugar
1/4 tspsalt
1 1/2 c (12 oz) whole milk
3 large eggs
2 tbsp unsalted butter, melted and cooled

Add oil to 10" nonstick skillet. Use paper towel to spread oil into thin, even coating on bottom of skillet. Discard paper towel. Heat skillet over low heat for at least 5 min. While skillet is heating, in large bowl, whisk together flour, sugar, and salt. In medium bowl, whisk together milk and eggs. Add 1/2 of milk mixture to flour mixture and whisk until smooth. Add melted butter and whisk until combined. Add remaining milk mixture and whisk until smooth. Set cooling rack next to stove. Increase heat to medium and heat skillet for 1 more min. Use 1/4 c dry measuring cup to scoop 1/4 c batter from bowl. Lift skillet off heat and pour batter into far side of skillet. Swirl skillet gently in circles and shake until batter evenly covers bottom of skillet. Return skillet to heat and cook until surface looks dry and crepe starts to brown at edges, 1-1 1/2 min. Working quickly, slide spatula under crepe and flip crepe. Cook until second side is spotty brown, 15-30 s. Carefully slide crepe from skillet onto cooling rack (use spatula to help transfer if needed). Return skillet to heat. Repeat with remaining batter, stacking cooked crepes on top of each other on cooling rack. Turn off heat. Transfer stack of crepes to large microwave-safe plate. Place second plate, upside down, on top of crepes. Heat in microwave until warm, 30-60 s. Use oven mitts to remove from microwave and remove top plate. Fill crepes with your favorite fillings, fold in half or into quarters, and top with your favorite toppings. Serve.

Topping suggestions:
Sweet: Nutella, jam, sliced bananas, sliced strawberries, or sugar; dust with confectionersâ€™ sugar
Savory: Shredded or crumbled cheese, ham, or scrambled eggs; chopped herbs or sliced scallions
