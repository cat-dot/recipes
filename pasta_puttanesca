Skillet Pasta Puttanesca
  --Cook's Illustrated

3x14.5 oz cans whole peeled tomatoes
3 tbsp evoo
8 anchovy fillets, rinsed and minced
6 medium garlic cloves, minced or pressed through a garlic press (~2 tbsp)
1/2 tsp red pepper flakes
salt
2 c water
12 oz thin spaghetti or spaghettini, broken in half
1/2 c pitted kalamata olives, chopped coarse
1/4 c minced fresh parsley leaves
3 tbsp capers, rinsed
ground black pepper
freshly grated parmesan cheese, for serving

Pulse the tomatoes with their juice in a food processor until coarsly ground and no large pieces remain, ~12 pulses. Cook 2 tbsp of the oil, anchovies, garlic, and red pepper flakes together in a 12" nonstick skillet over medium low heat, stirring constantly until the garlic is fragrant but not browned, 1-2 min. Stir in the processed tomatoes and 1/2 tsp salt. Simmer gently, stirring occasionally, until the tomatoes no longer taste raw, ~10 min. Stir in the water, then add the pasta. Cover, increase the heat to medium high, and cook, stirring often and adjusting the heat to maintain a vigorous simmer, until the pasta is tender, 12-15 min. Stir in the remaining 1 tbsp oil, the olives, parsley, and capers, season with salt and pepper to taste, and serve. Top with parmesan as desired.
