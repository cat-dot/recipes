Panang Beef Curry
  --America's Test Kitchen

2 lbs boneless beef short ribs, trimmed
2 tbsp vegetable oil
2-4 tbsp thai red curry pasge
14 oz can unsweetened coconut milk
4 tsp fish sauce
2 tsp sugar
1 thai red chile, halved lengthwise (optional)
6 makrut lime leaves, middle vein removed, sliced thin
1/3 c unsalted dry roasted peanuts, chopped fine

Cut each rib crosswise with grain into 3 equal pieces. Slice each piece against grain 1/4" thick. Place beef in large saupcepan and add water to cover. Bring to boil over high heat. Cover, reduce heat to low, and cook until beef is fork tender, 1-1 1/4 hr. Using slotted spoon, transfer beef to bowl; discard water. Beef can be refrigerated for up to 24 hr; when ready to user, add to curry. Heat oil  in 12" nonstick skillet over medium heat until shimmering. Add 2 tbsp curry paste and cook, stirring frequently, until paste is fragrant and darkens in color to brick red, 5-8 min. Add coconut milk, fish sauce, sugar, and chile, if using; stir to combine and dissolve sugar. Taste sauce and add up to 2 tbsp more curry paste to achieve desired spiciness. Add beef, stir to coat with sauce, and bring to simmer. Rapidly simmer, stirring occasionally, until sauce is thickened and reduced by half and coats beef, 12-15 min. Sauce should be quite thick, and streaks of oil will appear. Sauce will continue to thicken as it cools. Add makrut lime leaves and simmer until fragrant, 1-2 min. Transfer to serving platter, sprinkle with peanuts, and serve.


Notes: If you can't find makrut lime leaves, can sub 3x3" strips each of lemon zest and lime zest, adding them to the sauce with the beef, removing before serving.
