Baked Potato Puffs

1 c cooked plain mashed potatoes (yukon or russet)
salt and cayenne to taste
small pinch freshly grated nutmeg
butter for mini muffin tin
1/4 c water
2 tbsp butter
1/4 c flour
pinch of salt
1 large egg, beaten

Preheat oven to 450F. Bring water, butter, and a pinch of salt to a boil over medium heat. As soon as butter is melted and starts to bubble, stir in the flour using a wooden spoon. Cook for a few minutes until it pulls together to for a dough, pulling away from bottom and sides of pan cleanly. Transfer to a bowl, spread out and let cool 5 min before stiring in beaten egg with spatula. Once it comes together as a soft, sticky dough, add mashed potatoes and mix until well combined. Taste for seasoning and adjust as necessary; add cayenne & nutmeg. Scoop into prepared muffin tin and bake for 20 min or until golden brown and puffed. Let cool for a minute before transfering them to a cooling rack. 


Note:Makes 12; probably want to double or triple recipe. Can add in cheese, bacon, etc at the same time as adding in nutmeg. These might work in a regular sized muffin tin, but will need to bake longer.
