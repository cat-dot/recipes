Mochi using a microwave

3/4 c glutinous rice flour (Shiratamako is best, Mochiko will work)
3/4 c water
1/4 c sugar
1/2 c cornstarch (or potato starch)

In a microwavable bowl, mix the rice flour and sugar together. Add water to the mixture. Cover the bowl loosely with plastic wrap. Microwave for 1 min then stir. Place back in the microwave for 1 min, then stir again. Microwave for 30 s more and remove. On top of a large cutting board, place parchment paper and pour all the cornstarch on top of it. Place the mochi on top of the cornstarch and roll it out until it's 1/4" thick. Refrigerate for 15 min for the mochi to set. Using kitchen shears, cut into strips, then cut into squares
