Bring a large pot of salted water to boil. Add the pasta and cook until al dente, 8 min. Drain in a colander and transfer to a large bowl. Toss with 1 tbsp of oil to prevent sticking and set aside. In a medium bowl, toss the cheeses together and set aside. Preheat the broiler. In a 6 quart dutch oven, heat the remaining 2 tbsp of oil and butter over medium high heat. Add the sausage and cook, stirring often, until lightly golden, 3-4 min. Add the garlic and onion, and cook until softened and lightly caramelized, 8-10 min. Stir in the apples and cook until lightly softened, 4-6 min. Pour in the hard cider and cook, stirring to scrape the brown bits off the bottom of the pot, until the cider has evaporated, 2-3 min. Sprinkle the flour over the mixture, stirring to evenly coat all the contents of the pot, 1-2min. Slowly pour in the milk, stirring constantly, until incorporated without any lumps. Bring to a simmer and cook sitrring often, until thickened, 5 min. Add all but 1 c of the cheese mixture and the minced sage and thyme. Stir until the cheese has melted and is incorporated, 1 min. Add the cooked pasta and toss to coat, then remove from the heat and season with salt and pepper. Transfer all of the pasta to a 9x13" baking dish and sprinkle with the remaining cheese. Broil until the cheese is bubbly and golden, 2-3 min. Let rest for 10 min, then serve.
