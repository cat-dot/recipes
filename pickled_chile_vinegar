Pickled Fresno Chile Vinegar

2 c boiling water
1/2 c + 2 tbsp white distilled vinegar, divided
6 tbsp salt, divided
8 oz (7) fresno chiles
5 garlic cloves

In a plastic quart container, combine the boiling water, 2 tbsp vinegar, and 2 tbsp of salt. Stir until dissolved and let cool. Once cool, add the chiles and the garlic, and loosely cover with the lid, making sure the chiles are completely submerged. Let ferment at room temp for 4 weeks. Once fermented, drain the chiles and garlic, reserving 1/2 c of the pickling liquid. Transfer the chiles, garlic, and reserved liquid to a blender with the remaining 1/2 c of vinegar and 1/4 c salt. Blend until smooth. Return to the plastic container and seal. Let sit at room temp for 1 week, shaking everyday until homogenous. Keep in fridge up to 3 months.
