Healthy Butterfingers
   -chocolate covered Katie

1/4 c agave or honey (see note below)
1 tbsp regular or blackstrap molasses - Or omit and increase agave to 1/3 c
3 1/2 tbsp sugar or xylitol
1 c peanut butter, or allergy-friendly sub
1 1/2 c bran flakes, or corn flakes, or another flake cereal (56g)
1/8 tsp salt + a little extra if using unsalted pb
optional topping: 2/3 c chocolate chips or 1/4 c virgin coconut oil mixed with 1/4 c cocoa powder and vanilla stevia drops or liquid sweetener to taste

Recipe: Combine first three ingredients in a small saucepan, and bring to a boil on medium heat. Boil ~1 min stirring constantly, then remove from heat. Add the pb and salt, and stir until it makes a paste. Add the cereal and stir very well to coat, partially crushing the cereal. Make sure the flakes are evenly coated. Press into a 8x8" lined or greased pan; freeze until completely hardened. If you wish to cover with chocolate, can do before or after cutting. Simply melt chocolate or melt coconut oil with the sweetener and cocoa, then spread over the bars and refreeze to harden. May wish to cut after thawing a bit.

Notes: Honey works, but itâ€™s not for strict vegans and will also add a slight honey flavor. Corn syrup will also work, and commenters have said brown rice syrup or pure maple syrup work as well. If subbing out the molasses, bars will taste less authentic but still delicious. If using xylitol, texture will be less toffee-like. Almond butter or Sunbutter work, or use peanut butter for the flavor that most closely resembles real Butterfingers. To make gluten-free, use gluten-free cereal flakes.
