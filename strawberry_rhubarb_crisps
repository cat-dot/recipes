Strawberry Rhubarb Crisps

Topping:
3/4 c (3 3/4 oz) ap flour
1/2 c panko bread crumbs
1/4 c packed (1 3/4 oz) light brown sugar
1/2 tsp table salt
1/4 tsp ground cinnamon
6 tbsp unsalted butter, melted

Whisk flour, panko, sugar, salt, and cinnamon together in bowl. Add melted butter and stir until no dry spots of flour remain and mixture forms clumps. Refrigerate until ready to use.

Filling:
1 lb fresh rhubarb, trimmed and cut into 1/2" pieces, or frozen rhubarb, thawed and cut into 1/2" pieces (3 1/2 c)
12 oz fresh strawberries, hulled and chopped coarse, or frozen strawberries, thawed and chopped coarse (2 c)
1 1/4 c packed (8 3/4 oz) light brown sugar
2 tbsp cornstarch
1/8 tsp table salt

Adjust oven rack to middle position and heat oven to 375F. Toss all ingredients in large bowl until thoroughly combined. Transfer to 10" ovensafe skillet. Cook over medium-high heat, stirring frequently, until fruit has released enough liquid to be mostly submerged, rhubarb is just beginning to break down, and juices have thickened, ~8 min. Remove skillet from heat. Squeeze topping into large clumps with your hands. Crumble topping into pea-size pieces and sprinkle evenly over filling. Bake until topping is browned and filling is bubbling around sides of skillet, ~20 min. Let cool for 15 min. Serve.



Notes: If using frozen strawberries, there's no need to thaw them completely; you can chop them as soon as they're soft enough. If using frozen strawberries and frozen rhubarb, you may need to increase the stovetop cooking time by up to 4 min. Depending on the amount of trimming required, you may need to buy more than 1 lb of rhubarb to ensure that you end up with 3 1/2 c. Serve with vanilla ice cream.
