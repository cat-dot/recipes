Zucchini Noodles with Creamy Avocado Pesto

Noodles:
2 large zucchini, spiralized
1 tbsp olive oil

Spiralize your zucchini and set aside on paper towels so that any excess water is absorbed.

Sauce:
2 ripe avocados
1 c fresh basil leaves
3 cloves garlic
1/4 c pine nuts
2 tbsp lemon juice
1/2 tsp sea salt
1/4 c olive oil
cracked black pepper to taste

In a food processor, add avocados, basil leaves, garlic, pine nuts, lemon juice, and salt and pulse until finely chopped. With the motor still running, add olive oil in slow stream until emulsified and creamy.


Drizzle olive oil in a large skillet over medium high heat then add noodles, cooking for ~1-2 min until tender. Add noodles to a large bowl and toss with pesto. Season with cracked pepper and a little parmesan.
