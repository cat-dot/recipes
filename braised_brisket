Braised Brisket with Porcini Mushrooms

2 oz dried porcini mushrooms
1 1/2 c boiling water
1/4 c olive oil
6 lb brisket
kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper to taste
3 garlic cloves, peeled and halved
3 bay leaves
2 yellow onions, thinly sliced
1 rosemary sprig
1/2 c tomato paste
1 c red wine
5 c chicken stock
chopped parsley for garnish

Preheat oven to 325F. In a small bowl, cover the dried porini with the boiling water. Weigh them down with a plate to fully submerge them and let site until rehydrated, 15 min. Drain the mushrooms, reserving the liquid, and set both aside. In a large dutch oven, heat the olive oil over medium high heat. Season the brisket with salt and pepper. Sear the brisket, flipping once, until goledn brown, 4-5 min per side. Transfer the brisket to a plate. Add the reserve mushrooms, garlic, bay leaves, onion, and rosemary to the pan, and cook until the onions are translucent, 8-10 min. Add the tomato paste and cook, stirring constantly, until caramelized, 2 min. Add the reserved porcini liquid and the win, and bring to a simmer. Cook until the liquid has nearly completely evaporated, 10 min. Add the chicken stock and the brisket back to the pan and bring to a boil. Cover the pot and transfer to the oven. Bake, flipping the brisket once halfway through cooking, until tender when pierced with a fork, 2.5-3hrs. Place the pot back on the stovetop and transfer the brisket to a cutting board. Bring the cooking liquid to a boil and reduce until thickened, 25-30 min. Meanwhile, let the brisket cool for 10 min, then thinly slice it against the grain. Once the cooking liquid is reduced, add the sliced brisket back to the pot to warm through. Transfer to a platter and garnish with chopped parsley.
