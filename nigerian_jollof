Sauce:
3 red bell pepper
3 plum tomatoes
2 scotch bonnet
1 diced onion

Blend until smooth.

Rice:
6 c long grain rice
3/4 c olive oil
5 tbsp tomato paste
4 c chicken stock
1 tbsp curry powder
1 tbsp thyme
4 cloves Garlic
2 bay leaves
1 tbsp grated ginger
1 tsp salt or to taste
1 medium onion (diced)
1 tomato sliced (large size)
1 tbsp seasoning powder or seasoning cubes
1 onion sliced
white or black pepper to taste

In a large pan, preheat the cooking oil. Once the oil is hot, add the diced onions and fry for ~3-5 min or till the onions become soft. Add the tomato paste. Fry for ~5 min, then add the garlic, ginger, and bay leaves and let it cook  for ~2 minutes. Add the sauce and allow the pepper to cook until the water is reduced entirely and the oil is seen floating on the fried pepper. Season with thyme, curry powder, salt to taste, and seasoning cubes. Leave to cook for another 2-5 min. Stir in the rice until it is well coated with the sauce. Add the chicken stock and cover it with a tight-fitting lid, then allow it to come to a boil. Once it starts boiling  ~3-5 min after placing it on the stove, reduce the heat immediately to medium-low and steam until the rice is done. Turn off the heat and add the sliced tomato and onions, and stir together briefly. Then, cover it up immediately so that the heat remaining in the rice can steam up the vegetables a little bit.
