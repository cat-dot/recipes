Patates Lemonates (Greek Lemon Potatoes)
  --Natasha Kravchuk
  
1 c chicken stock
1/2 c evoo
1/4 c lemon juice
4 garlic cloves, minced
2 tsp dried oregano
2 tsp fine sea salt
2 tbsp unsalted butter, to dot the top
3 lbs Yukon gold potatoes, cut into quarters or 1" thick wedges
1 tbsp parsley, finely chopped for garnish

Preheat the oven to 400F. In a 9×13" casserole dish, add olive oil, lemon juice, chicken stock, garlic, oregano, and salt and stir to combine. Add sliced potatoes and toss to coat in the pan sauce, then spread them evenly in the pan (the potatoes won’t be fully submerged and that’s ok). Dot the tops of the potatoes with butter. Bake for 70-80 min or until fork-tender. Stir a couple of times through baking to coat the potatoes in the pan juices. By the end of the baking time, most of the liquid will be absorbed except for the oil. If you love crisp edges on the potatoes, broil for 3-4 min to brown the tops of the potatoes. Remove from the oven and toss to coat in the pan sauces. You can serve the potatoes right out of the casserole dish or transfer them to a platter and drizzle some of the pan sauce over the top. Garnish with finely chopped parsley.\
