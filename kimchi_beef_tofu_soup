Kimchi, Beef, and Tofu Soup
  --Cook's Country
  
1 lb 85 percent lean ground beef
1/2 tsp table salt
1/2 tsp pepper
1 tbsp grated fresh ginger
1/2 c mirin
3 c water
3 c kimchi, drained with 1⁄4 c brine reserved, chopped coarse
2 c chicken broth
8 oz firm tofu, cut into 1⁄2" cubes
2 tbsp soy sauce
4 scallions, sliced thin
1 tbsp toasted sesame oil

Combine beef, salt, and pepper in Dutch oven; cook over medium-high heat, breaking up meat with wooden spoon, until moisture evaporates and beef begins to sizzle, 8-10 min. Add ginger and cook until fragrant, about 30 seconds. Stir in mirin, scraping up any browned bits. Stir in water, kimchi and reserved brine, broth, tofu, and soy sauce and bring to boil. Reduce heat to low; cover; and simmer to allow flavors to meld, ~15 min. Off heat, stir in scallions and oil. Serve.


Notes: If there’s not enough brine in the kimchi jar to yield 1/4 c, add water to compensate.
