3 tbsp ap flour
2 c whole milk, warmed slightly
20 oz cheddar cheese, grated and divided

Cook the pasta, al dente, per package instructions. Liberally butter 9x13" casserole dish and set aside. Preheat oven to 350F. Warm the oil over medium heat in a large saucepan. Add onions and saute for ~8 min, until browned slightly and fragrant. Add garlic and saute for a couple minutes longer. Transfer to a bowl and set aside. Return the pan to stovetop and melt butter over medium heat. Add the flour and stir for ~1 min, creating a roux, until blond and smooth. Little by little, whisk in the warmed milk. Continue to whisk the roux for another 1-2 min, until smooth and starting to bubble. Add 16 oz cheese and stir until melted and smooth. Stir in onion mixture, nutmeg, hot sauce, and a pinch of salt. Remove the sauce from the heat, and stir in the eggs until fully combined. Combine the coked pasta and the sauce in the prepared casserole until the noodles are evenly coated. Top with the remaining cheese. In a small mixing bowl, combine the chips with a pinch of salt and a few grinds of pepper. Top the casserole evenly with the chips. Bake for 40-45 minm until bubbly and golden on top. Let cool for at least 15 min before serving. 

Notes: can carefully broil top if you like a browner top.
