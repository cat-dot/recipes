Potato Pancakes with Smoked Applesauce
  --Ilan Hall

Applesauce:
1/2 c applewood chips
4 granny smith apples, quartered, seeds removed
1/2 c light brown sugar
1 1/2 tsp kosher salt
2 1/2 tbsp fresh lemon juice

Place a piece of foil on the bottom of a large pot. Place the wood chips on the foil and layer another piece of foil loosely on top. Place the steamer insert over the wood chips. Place the apples directly onto the steam basket, flesh side down. Cover and smoke over medium heat for 30-40 min or until the apples are very soft. Remove from the heat and set aside. In a blender, puree the apples, sugar, salt, and lemon juice on high speed until smooth. Remove and set aside; makes 2 cups.

Pancakes:
2 russet potatoes
2 sweet onions, peeled and left whole
kosher salt
canola oil for frying

Using a food processor or box grater, shred the potatoes and onions, and season generously with salt. Transfer to a fine mesh strainer or a kitchen towl and squeeze/wring out all of the liquid over a large bowl. Discard the liquid. Line a rimmed baking sheet with parchment paper. Using a 2" ring mold, form 16 potato pancakes and place onto the baking sheet. Chilll in the freezer for 30 min. In a large nonstick skillet over medium heat, warm 3 tbsp of oil. Working in batches, fry the potato pancakes until they turn light golden brown and hold their shape, 3-4 min per side. Remove from the heat and set aside. Set a wire rack inside a paper towel lined baking sheet and set aside. Wipe skillet clean and place it back on the stove over medium heat. Pour in enough oil to reach a depth of 1/2". Working in batches, fry the pancakes, flipping occasionally, until crisp and golden brown, 10-14 min. Transfer to rack and season with salt while still warm. Serve with the smoked applesauce.
