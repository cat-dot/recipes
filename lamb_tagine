Lamb Tagine

Spice Mixture:
1 tsp cumin seeds
1 tsp coriander seeds
1/4 tsp decorticted cardamom
1 tsp sweet paprika
1/2 tsp ground ginger
1/2 tsp tumeric
2" cinnamon sticks

Combine cumin and coriander in a small heavy skillet and cook over very low heat until fragrant and toasted, 5-7 min; cool 5 min. Transfer spices to a spice grinder with the cardamom and process until finely ground. Stir in the paprika and tumeric and set aside with the cinnamon sticks.

Stew:
2 lbs boneless lamb stew meat cut into 3/4" cubes
ghee or avocado oil
sea salt and freshly ground pepper
1 medium-large yellow onion, diced 1/3"
2 c beef broth or chicken broth
4 oz dried apricots
2 oz sultana raisins
1 box quick couscous
2 tbsp chopped cilantro or parsley

Preheat oven to 300F. Heat 1 tbsp of ghee in a 4 quart enameled casserole or heavy saucepan over medium heat. Add 1/4 of the lamb, season with salt and pepper and cook, turning infrequently, until nicely browned, ~7 min. Transfer the seared meat to a bowl and repeat with remaining lamb in 3 more batches, addding more fat as needed. Add the onion and another tbsp of ghee to the same pot and cook over medium heat, stirring occasionally, until starting to soften, ~5 min. Add the spice mixture and cook 1 min more. Return the seared lamb and any juices to the pot, along with the broth, cover and bring to a simmer. Transfer the pot to the oven and braise gently until meat is tender, ~1 hr. Meantime cook the couscous according to package directions. Remove the lamb from the oven to the stovetop and stir in the apricots. Let sit for several min. You can cook the stew up to 2 days ahead. Serve atop coucous and garnish with chopped cilantro or parsley
