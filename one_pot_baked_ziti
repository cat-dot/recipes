  --Cook's Country
  
8 oz sweet Italian sausage, casings removed
3 garlic cloves, minced
28 oz can tomato sauce
14.5 oz can diced tomatoes
3/4 tsp salt
1/2 tsp dried oregano
1/2 tsp sugar
1/8 tsp red pepper flakes
2 cups water
12 oz (3 3/4 c) ziti
6 tbsp chopped fresh basil
7 oz (7 c) baby spinach, chopped coarse
6 oz whole-milk mozzarella cheese, cut into 1/4" pieces (1 1/2 c), divided
2 oz Parmesan cheese, grated (1 c), divided
8 oz (1 c) whole-milk ricotta cheese

Cook sausage in Dutch oven over medium-high heat, breaking up pieces with spoon, until lightly browned, ~5 min. Add garlic and cook until fragrant, ~30 s. Stir in tomato sauce, diced tomatoes and their juice, salt, oregano, sugar, and pepper flakes. Bring mixture to boil, reduce heat to medium-low, and simmer until thickened, ~10 min. Stir in water, pasta, and 4 tbsp basil. Increase heat to high and bring to boil. Reduce heat to medium and simmer vigorously, uncovered, until pasta is still very firm but just starting to soften, 6-8 min, stirring frequently. Adjust oven rack 8" from broiler element and heat broiler. Remove pot from heat and stir in spinach, 3/4 c mozzarella, and 1/2 c Parmesan. Dollop surface of pasta evenly with spoonfuls of ricotta. Top with remaining 3/4 c mozzarella and 1/4 c Parmesan. Broil ziti until cheese is bubbling and beginning to brown, 5-7 min. Transfer to wire rack and let cool for 10 min. Sprinkle with remaining 2 tbsp basil and serve.
