Chicken and Mushroom Orzo with Tarragon Sauce
  --Ana Pozo

2 chicken breasts, sliced (or skinless chicken thighs)
1 3/4 c orzo
1/4 c fresh tarragon leaves
1 tbsp olive oil
3 tbp unsalted butter
5 garlic cloves, minced
1 shallot, minced
8 oz cremini mushrooms, sliced
3 oz shiitake mushrooms, sliced
1/2 c dry white wine
1 c heavy whipping cream
1 1/2 c chicken broth
Sea salt and freshly ground black pepper
1 tbsp red pepper flakes
1/2 c grated Parmigiano-Reggiano cheese
1/4 c grated Pecorino Romano

Preheat the oven to 375F. Heat 1 tbsp of olive oil in a large oven-safe skillet set over medium-high heat. Rub the chicken with 1 tbsp olive oil, salt, and pepper. When the oil is shimmering, add the chicken. Sear on both sides until golden, ~3-4 min per side. Remove the chicken from the skillet. To the same skillet, on medium, add the butter and 1 tbsp of olive oil. Add the shallot, garlic, red pepper flakes and tarragon cooking until fragrant, ~3 min. Add the mushrooms (but leave a handful for later) and continue cooking for another 3 min, add the chicken and orzo to the pan and cook until lightly golden, 2-3 min. Add the wine and de-glaze the pan, then add the broth. Bring to a boil, cook 3-5 min, then add the cream, parmesan and pecorino, stirring it until it all comes together. If needed, add more broth to the pan. Cover and let it cook for 3-5 m min on low. Take the remainder of the mushrooms and place them in the middle of the pan, sprinkle black pepper and add a 1 tbsp of butter on top of the mushrooms. Drizzle olive oil over the pan and transfer to the oven. Cook, uncovered for 10-15 min, until the chicken is cooked through and the mushrooms are golden.
