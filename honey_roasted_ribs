Honey Roasted Ribs
  --Cook's Country

2 (2.5-3lb) racks baby back ribs, trimmed, membranes removed, each rack cut into 3 equal pieces
1 c honey
5 tbsp shoyu
1/4 c cider vinegar
1/4 c dijon mustard
4 scallions, white parts minced, green parts sliced thin
4 garlic cloves crushed
kosher salt and pepper
1/4 tsp cayenne pepper

Divide ribs between 2 1 gallon ziplock bags. Whisk honey, shoyu, vinegar, mustard, scallion whites, garlic, 1 tsp salt, 1 tsp pepper, and cayenne together in a bowl. Divide marinade between bags, seal, and turn to coat ribs evenly. Refrigerate for at least 1 hr, or up to 24 hrs, turning bags occasionally. Adjust oven rack to middle and preheat to 325F. Line rimmed baking sheet with foil and set wire rack in sheet. Add enough warm water to cover entire bottom of sheet (~2 c). Transfer ribs, meaty side up, to prepared wire rack; reserve marinade in refrigerator. Tent ribs loosely with foil and bake for 1 1/4 hrs. Uncover ribs and continue to cook until just tender, ~1 hr longer. Bring reserved marinade to boil in dutch oven over medium high heat and cook until thickened to glaze consistency, ~5 min. Brush ribs with 1/3 c glaze, return to oven and continue to cook until glaze begins to bubble and ribs are brown, 15-30 min. Transfer ribs to cutting board (leave hot water and sheet in oven to cool), tent loosely with foil, and let rest for 10 min. Cut ribs between bones, add to dutch oven and toss to coat with remaining glaze. Transfer to platter and sprinkle with scallion greens and 1.2 tsp salt. Server.
