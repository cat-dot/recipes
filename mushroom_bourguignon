Mushroom Bourguignon
  --Deb Perelman Smitten Kitchen
  
2 tbsp olive oil
2 tbsp butter, softened
2 lb portobello mushrooms, in 1/4" slices (save the stems for another use) (you can use cremini instead, as well)
1/2 carrot, finely diced
1 small yellow onion, finely diced
2 cloves garlic, minced
1 c full-bodied red wine
2 c beef or vegetable broth (beef broth is traditional but vegetable to make it vegetarian; it works with either)
2 tbsp tomato paste
1 tsp fresh thyme leaves (1/2 tsp dried)
1 1/2 tbsp ap flour
1 c pearl onions, peeled (thawed if frozen)
egg noodles, for serving
sour cream and chopped chives or parsley, for garnish (optional)

Heat 1 tbsp of the olive oil and 1 tbsp of butter in a medium dutch oven or heavy sauce pan over high heat. Sear the mushrooms until they begin to darken, but not yet release any liquid â€” about three or four minutes. Remove them from pan. Lower the flame to medium and add the second tbsp of olive oil. Toss the carrots, onions, thyme, a few good pinches of salt and a several grinds of black pepper into the pan and cook for 10 min, stirring occasionally, until the onions are lightly browned. Add the garlic and cook for just one more minute. Add the wine to the pot, scraping any stuck bits off the bottom, then turn the heat all the way up and reduce it by half. Stir in the tomato paste and the broth. Add back the mushrooms with any juices that have collected and once the liquid has boiled, reduce the temperature so it simmers for 20 min, or until mushrooms are very tender. Add the pearl onions and simmer for 5 min more. Combine remaining butter and the flour with a fork until combined; stir it into the stew. Lower the heat and simmer for 10 more min. If the sauce is too thin, boil it down to reduce to the right consistency. Season to taste. To serve, spoon the stew over a bowl of egg noodles, dollop with sour cream (optional) and sprinkle with chives or parsley.
