Breakfast Sausage
  --Cook's Country

2 lbs ground pork
1 garlic clove, minced
1 tbsp maple syrup
2 tsp dried sage
1/2 tsp dried thyme
1 tsp salt
1 1/2 tsp pepper
1/8 tsp cayenne
2 tbsp unsalted butter

Mix everything except the butter in a large bowl gently with hands until well combined. Form mixture into 2 1/2" patties, ~1/2" thick (MAkes ~16 patties). Melt 1 tbsp butter in large nonstick skillet over medium heat. Cook half the patties until well browned and cook through, 3-5 min per side. Transfer to paper towel lined plate and tent with foil. Wipe out skillet and repeat with remaining patties. Serve.

Notes: Raw patties can be refrigerated, covered, for 1 day or frozen for up to 1 month. To cook frozen, takes 7-9 min per side. Avoid lean or extra lean ground pork, it makes the sausage dry, crumbly, and less flavorful. To form patties, use greased measuring cup.
