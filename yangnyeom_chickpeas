Yangnyeom Chickpeas
  --Eric Kim

15 oz can chickpeas, drained, rinsed, and dried on a paper towel
2 tbsp olive oil
kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper
3 tbsp ketchup
1 tbsp gochujang
1 tbsp strawberry jam
1 tbsp shoyu
1 tbsp minced garlic
1 tbsp honey
1 tbsp toasted sesame seeds
2 large scallions, julienned into long thin strips, soaked in iced water

Heat the oven to 400F. On a sheet pan, toss the chickpeas with the olive oil and a few pinches of salt and pepper. Bake until crispy, 25-30 min, shaking the pan halfway through baking. Meanwhile, in a small saucepan or skillet, combine the ketchup, gochujang, strawberry jam, soy sauce, and garlic and bring to a gentle simmer over medium-high heat, stirring constantly. Cook this yangnyeom sauce until fragrant, ~1 min. Add the crispy chickpeas to the pan and continue to cook, stirring constantly, until the sauce reduces slightly and gets absorbed by the chickpeas, and the chickpeas get sticky, 2-3 min. Move the chickpeas to one side of the pan and add the honey to the empty side. Let the honey bubble up, stirring all the while, and cook down until reduced and caramelized, ~1 min or so. Stir the chickpeas into the honey and watch as they glisten up. Remove from the heat. To serve, transfer the chickpeas to a plate and sprinkle with the sesame seeds and scallions.


Notes: Soaking long strands of scallions in ice-cold water will cause them to curl
