Banana Buckwheat Pancakes

Pancakes:
1 1/2 c buckwheat flour
1 tsp baking soda
2 tsp cinnamon
1 large banana, mashed
2 large eggs
1 tsp vanilla
1/2 c unsweetened almond milk (or milk of choice)

Preheat a large skillet over medium low heat. In a large bowl, whisk together all of the ingredients until you have a smooth batter. Grease the skillet with oil of choice, and use 1/4 c measuring cup to scoop the batter onto the skillet. Cook the pancakes for 2-3 minutes on the first side, then flip and cook for another 2 min. 

Compote:
1 1/2 c fresh or frozen blackberries
1 tbsp coconut (or granulated) sugar
1/2 tsp vanilla
1/2 tbsp water
1/2 tsp arrowroot powder (optional) to thicken

Combine the berries, sugar, and canilla in a small saucepan over medium heat. Use a wooden spoon to stir until the sugar coats the berries. Gently break up the berries with the spoon until they start to break down and turn into a thick sauce. If you want it thicker, add the arrowroot (or tapioca starch) to the sauce. Stir to thicken.
