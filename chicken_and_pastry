Chicken and Pastry (aka dumplings)
  --Cook's Country

1 1/2 c (7 1/2 oz) ap flour
2 tsp baking powder
salt and pepper
1/2 c milk
2 tbsp unsalted butter, melted + 1 tbsp unsalted butter
2 lb bone in chicken thighs, trimmed
4 c chicken broth
1 c water
1 onion, peeled and halved through root end
1 celery rib, halved crosswise

Combine flour, baking powder, 1/2 tsp salt, and 1/2 tsp pepper in large bowl. Combine milk and melted butter in second bowl. Using rubber spatula, stir milk mixture into flour mixture until just incorporated. Turn dough out onto lightly floured surface and knead until no flour streaks remain, ~1 min. Return dough to large bowl, cover with plastic wrap, and set aside. Pat chicken dry with paper towels and season with pepper. Melt remaining butter in dutch oven over medium high heat. Add chicken, skin side down, and cook until golden brown, 3-5 min. Flip chicken and continue to cook until golden brown on second side, 3-5 min longer. Add broth and water, scraping up any fond. Nestle onion and celery into pot and bring to boil. Reduce heat to low, cover, and simmer for 25 min. Meanwhile, roll dough into 12" square ~1/8" thick. Using pizza cutter or knife, cut dough lengthwise into 1" wide strips, then cut diagonally into 1" wide strips to form diamonds; pieces around edges won't be diamonds, that's ok. Remove pot from heat. Transfer chicken to plate and let cool slightly. Discar onion and celery. Return broth to boil over medium high heat and add pastry. Reduce heat to low, cover, and simmer, stirring occasionally, until pastry is tender and puffed, ~15 min. While pastry cooks, shred chicken into bit size pieces, discarding skin and bones. Stir chicken into pot and cook, uncovered, until warmed through and stew has thickened slightly, 2-4 min. Season with salt and pepper to taste. Serve.
