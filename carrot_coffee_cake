Crumble:
1/2 c sweetened flake coconut
1/3 c chopped pecans
1 1/2 tbsp firmly packed light brown sugar
1 tbsp ap flour
1 tbsp unsalted butter, melted

In a medium bowl, stir together the coconut, pecans, sugar, and flour. Using a wooden spoon, stir in the melted butter until the mixture is crumbly.

Cake:
3/4 c vegetable oil
1/2 c firmly packed light brown sugar
1/2 c sugar
2 large eggs
1 tsp vanilla
1 c ap flour
1 1/2 tsp cinnamon
1/2 tsp baking powder
1/4 tsp kosher salt
1 c shredded carrots
1/2 c crushed pineapple, drained
1/2 c chopped pecans
1/2 c sweetened flaked coconut

Preheat oven to 350F; butter and flour a 9" cake round. In the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with the paddle attachment, mix the oil, both sugars, eggs, and vanilla at medium speed until combined. In a medium bowl, whisk together the flour, cinnamon, baking powder, and salt. Turn the mixer on low speed and gradually add the flour mixture to the oil mixture, beating until just combined. Stir in the carrots, pineapple, pecans, and coconut. Spread the batter into the prepared pan and bake for 25 min. Sprinkle with crumble and bake for ~10 min more, until a tester inserted into the center comes out clean. Let cool in pan for 10 min, then remove from pan and let cool on a wire rack.

Whipped Cream:
1 c heavy whipped cream
1/2 c whole buttermilk
2 1/2 tbsp sugar

In the bowl of stand mixer fitted with the whisk attachment, beat the cream and buttermilk at high speed until foamy. Gradually add the sugar, beating until stiff peaks form. Serve cake warm or at room temp with whipped cream.
