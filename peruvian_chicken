  --Cook's Country
  
6 tbsp evoo, divided
1/4 c fresh mint leaves
6 garlic cloves, peeled
3 1/2 tsp pepper, divided
1 tbsp ground cumin
1 tbsp sugar
2 tsp grated lime zest + 1/4 c juice (2 limes)
2 tsp table salt, divided
2 tsp smoked paprika
2 tsp dried oregano
1/2 habanero chile, stemmed and seeded
4x10 oz chicken leg quarters, trimmed
1 small head cauliflower (1 1/2 lb), cored and cut into 1 1/2" florets
1 lb sweet potatoes, peeled and cut into 1" pieces
1 small red onion, halved and sliced through root end into 1/2" thick wedges
3 c (3 oz) baby arugula

Process 3 tbsp oil, mint, garlic, 1 tbsp pepper, cumin, sugar, lime zest and juice, 1 1/2 tsp salt, paprika, oregano, and habanero in blender until smooth, 10-20 s. Transfer marinade to gallon zipper-lock bag. Add chicken, seal bag, and turn to coat chicken with marinade. Refrigerate for at least 1 hr or up to 12 hr. Adjust oven rack to middle position and heat oven to 425F. Toss cauliflower, potatoes, onion, remaining 3 tbsp oil, remaining 1/2 tsp pepper, and remaining 1/2 tsp salt together on rimmed baking sheet and spread into even layer. Bake until top edges of cauliflower and potatoes are lightly browned, ~15 min. Remove sheet from oven. Using spatula, push vegetables to 1 side of sheet (they will no longer be in single layer). Place chicken, skin side up, on now-empty side of sheet. Roast until chicken registers 175F and vegetables are tender, ~40 min, rotating sheet halfway through roasting. Transfer chicken to carving board; let rest for 10 min. Add arugula to sheet with vegetables and gently toss to combine. Transfer vegetable mixture to platter. Separate leg quarters into thighs and drumsticks, then transfer to platter with vegetable mixture. Serve.


Notes: can substitute 1 tablespoon of minced serrano chile for the habanero
