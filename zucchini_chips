Oven Baked Zucchini Chips

1 large zucchini, cut into 1/8"-1/4" slices
1/3 c whole grain breadcrumbs (or panko)
1/4 c finely grated parmesean cheese
1/4 tsp black pepper
kosher/sea salt to taste
1/8 tsp garlic powder
1/8 tsp cayenne pepper
3 tbsp low-fat milk

Preheat oven to 425F. In a small bowl, combine breadcrumbs, parmesean cheese, black peper, salt, garlic powder, and cayenne pepper. Dip zucchini slices into milk and drege into bread crumb mixture to coat both sides. It may be necessary to press crumbs onto zucchini slices to ensure the crumbs stick.
Arrange zucchini on a non-stick cookie sheet or a rack sprayed with non-stick; if using a rack, place it on a cookie sheet to catch the crumbs. Bake 15min, turn zucchini over and continue baking until golden brown, about 10-15min. Allow to cool to room temp before storing in an airtight container.
