Skillet Shrimp Chilaquiles 
  --Southern Kiving
  
Vegetable or canola oil

12 (6 1/2") corn tortillas
1 1/2 tsp kosher salt, divided
2 1/2 c green chile salsa (such as Herdez)
1 lb peeled and deveined raw medium shrimp
1/2 tbsp ancho chile powder
2 oz queso fresco (fresh Mexican cheese), crumbled (~1/2 c)
1 ripe avocado, diced
1/4 c packed fresh cilantro leaves

Preheat oven to 400F. Pour oil to a depth of 2" in a Dutch oven; heat oil over medium-high to 350F. Stack tortillas; cut stack into quarters to create 48 tortilla wedges. Fry wedges, 12 at a time, in hot oil until lightly browned, ~1 1/2 min per side. Quickly remove tortilla chips from oil, and drain on paper towels. Sprinkle chips evenly with 3/4 tsp of the salt. Cool to room temperature, ~10 min. Arrange half of chips in a 10" cast-iron skillet, and pour 1/2 c salsa over chips. Top with remaining chips and 2 c salsa. Cover skillet with heavy-duty aluminum foil, and bake in preheated oven 15 min. Meanwhile, toss shrimp with ancho chile powder and remaining 3/4 tsp salt. Remove skillet from oven, and increase oven temperature to broil. Remove and discard foil. Arrange shrimp on top of tortilla mixture. Return to oven, and broil just until shrimp turn pink, 3-5 min. Top with queso fresco, avocado, and cilantro. Serve immediately.
