Almond Balls
  --Grandma Tosh
  
1/2 c butter
1/2 c crisco
2 c ap flour
1 c ground almond
3/4 c powdered sugar
1 tsp vanilla
18 candied cherries (optional)
powdered sugar for dusting

Cream butter, crisco, and powdered sugar until fluffy. Add everything else except the cherries and mix well. Take heaping tsp of dough and form into ball; push half a cherry into middle and roll in your hands to form a ball. Bake @ 325F for 35 min. Roll in powdered sugar after cool. Makes 36.

Notes: I use dried cherries (whole) in place of candied cherries. Can use coarse ground almond meal if you don't want to chop up almonds. I've made with 100% butter (unsalted) and they come out delicious as well. I recommend rotating pan halfway through baking since most ovens don't bake evenly. In my oven, tend to bake for less time - taking them out when they are golden brown.
