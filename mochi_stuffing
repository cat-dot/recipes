Mochi Rice Stuffing

2 1/2 c mochi rice (aka glutinous sweet rice or sticky rice) rinsed
6 large dried shiitake mushrooms, soaked according to the package instructions
1 tbsp freshly grated ginger
1 tbsp + 2 tsp olive oil, divided
3 slices bacon, chopped
2 tsp oyster sauce (or shoyu)
1/2 tsp sugar
1 c diced onion (1 onion)
1/2 c chopped gren onion (3-4)
1/2 lb diced lap cheong or dried sweet sausage like chorizo or salami
1/4 lb diced char siu or sugar cured ham steak seared on both sides
1 1/2 c cooked chestnuts, roughly chopped
1 c chopped water chestnuts
salt and pepper to taste
2 large eggs, beaten
2 tbsp roughly chopped cilantro for garnish

If using a rice cooker, combine rice and ~2 1/2 c water and soak for 1 hr, then cook until tender, ~20 min. If cooking on the stovetop, combine rice with 2 1/2 c water in a large pot. Cover, bring to a boil, then reduce the heat to low and cook 20 min, or until water is almost completely absorbed. Remove from heat and let steam, covered, 15 min. Drain shiitakes, then remove stems and slice caps; set aside. In a small saucepan, combine gingner and 1 tbsp olive oil over medium low heat and cook 2 min, set aside and let steep. In a large skillet, cook bacon over medium heat until crisp, ~8 min; drain fat. In a small bowl, stir together oyster sauce and sugar, then add to the skillet with the bacon. Stir in onion, green onion, lap cheong, char siu, chestnuts, water chestnuts, ginger oil, and mushrooms. Cook over medium high heat until onions are translucent, ~4 min. Toss mix with the prepared rice; set aside. Heat 2 tsp oil in a small nonstick skillet over medium heat. Pour eggs into hot pan and cook until edges begin to set, ~10 s. Pull omelet in from the edges toward the center of the pan and let liquid eggs flow underneath. When eggs are mostly set, fold omelet in thirds like a letter and transfer to a cutting board. Slice into strips. Serve rice with slivered omelet and cilantro on top.
