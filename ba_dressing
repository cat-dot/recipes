3/4 c (1 1/2 sticks) unsalted butter + more for baking dish
1 lb good quality day old white bread, torn into 1" pieces (~10 c)
2 1/2 c chopped yellow onions
1 1/2 c 1/4" slices celery
1/2 c chopped flat leaf parsley
2 tbsp chopped fresh sage
1 tbsp chopped fresh thyme
2 tsp salt
1 tsp freshly ground black pepper
2 1/2 c low sodium chicken broth, divided
2 large eggs

Preheat oven to 250F. Butter a 13x9x2" baking dish and set aside. Scatter bread in a single layer on a rimmed baking sheet. Bake, stirring occasionally, until dried out, ~1 hr. Let cool; transfer to a very large bowl. Meanwhile, melt butter in a large skillet over medium high heat; add onions and celery. Stir often until just beginning to brown, ~10 min. Add to bowl with bread; stir in herbs, salt, and pepper. Drizzle in 1 1/4 c broth and toss gently. Let cool. Preheat oven to 350F. Whisk 1 1/4 c broth and eggs in a small bowl. Add to bread mixture; fold gently until thoroughly combined. Transfer to prepared dish, cover with foil, and bake until an instant read thermometer inserted into center registers 160F, ~40 min. Bake dressing, uncovered, until set and top is browned and crisp, 40-45 min longer (add 10-15 m if chilled)


Notes: Can be made 1 day ahead. Uncover, let cool. Cover, chill.
