Tuscan Bread Stuffing

1 1/2 lbs pounds (1 1/2 large loaves) ciabatta bread, cut into 1" cubes
8 oz pancetta
1 package turkey liver and gizzards (from 1 large turkey)
2 medium carrots, peeled and small dice
2 celery stalks, small dice
1 large yellow onion, small dice
2 sticks unsalted butter
1 c heavy cream
4 c turkey stock
1 1/2 c roasted chestnuts, roughly chopped
1 1/4 c dried cranberries
1/4 c minced sage
1/4 c minced rosemary
kosher salt and freshly ground pepper to taste

Preheat oven to 225F. Lay out the bread on a baking sheet and bake until dry, 25-30 min. Transfer the bread to a large bowl. Raise the oven temp to 350F. Heat the pancetta in a medium skillet over medium high heat. Cook, stirring often, until the pancetta is crispy and the fat has rendered, 8-10 min. Using a slotted spoon, transfer the pancetta to the bowl with the bread. Add the liver and gizzards to the pan and cook, turning as needed until golden and cooked through, 4-5 min for the liver and 8-10 min for gizzards. Transfer to a cutting board and roughly chop, then add to the bowl. To the pan, add the carrots, celery, and onion, and sweat until softened, 6-8 min. Transfer the veggies to the stuffing bowl. Add the butter to the pan and cook until it begins to brown and has a nutty aroma, 6-8 min. Stir in the cream to warm through. Add the butter mixture to the bowl with the remaining ingredients and using your hands, mix the stuffing to incorporate. Let sit at room temp for 1 hr. Transfer the stuffing to a 9x13" baking dish and bake until golden brown, 45-55 min. Let rest for 15 min, then serve.
