Carbonara with Kale and Hazelnuts

1/2 c hazelnuts
4 oz thinly sliced guanciale or pancetta finely chopped
5 egg yolks
1 1/2 c finely grated parmesan + more for serving
4 tbsp olive oil
2 tsp freshly ground black pepper + more for taste
kosher salt to taste
1/2 lb tuscan kale (~ 1 large bunch) stems trimmed, roughly chopped
1 lb spaghetti or bucatini
1 lemon

Preheat oven to 350F. Place hazelnuts on a rimmed baking sheet and toast in the oven until golden brown, 8-10 min. Let cool and roughly chop. Meanwhile, in a medium skillet over medium heat, add the guanciale and cook, stirring occasionally until the fat begins to render and becomes crisp, 10-12 min. Using a slotted spoon, transfer the guanciale to a bowl and set aside. Reserve the fat in a separate bowl and let cool. In a large serving bowl, whisk the yolks, parmesan, olive oil, black pepper, and reserved fat. Set aside. Prepare an ice bath and bring both a large and medium pot of salted water to boil. Add the kale to the medium pot and cook until tender, 3-4 min. Transfer the kale to the ice bath and let cool, 30 s - 1 m. Drain and squeeze out any excess water. Add the pasta to the large pot and acook until al dente, 8-9 min. Drain the pasta, reserving 1/2c of the water, and transfer the pasta to the egg mixture. Toss the pasta with the egg mixture, adding pasta water to create a creamy sauce. Zest half of the lemon over the pasta and add the guanciale, kale, and hazelnuts and toss. Taste and adjust the seasoning with salt and pepper. Tope with more parmesan and serve.
