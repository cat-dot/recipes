Chickpea and Oat Flapjacks

3/4 c (110g) chickpea flour
1 1/4 c (175g) oat flour
1/2 tsp baking soda
1 tsp baking powder
1 tsp sea salt
1 1/2 c buttermilk
1 c plain whole milk yogurt
2 tbsp maple syrup
2 large eggs, separated
2 oz unsalted butter, melted

In a medium sized mixing bowl, whisk together the flours, baking soda, baking powder, and salt to combine thoroughly. In a separate bowl, combine the buttermilk, yogurt, maple syrup, and egg yolks and whisk until they are smooth. Whip the egg whites either by hand or with an electric mixer with the whisk attachment until they are thick and stiff peaks form, about the consistency of shaving cream. Gently fold the whites into the buttermilk mixture. Add the buttermilk mixture and the melted butter into the dry ingredients and fold them together with a spatula until they are well mixed, but still slightly lumpy. Heat a griddle or cast iron pan over medium heat until a drop of water sizzles and cook the flapjacks, about a minute per side, until they are cooked through. Serve immediately or keep warm in a low oven until ready to serve.
