Spaghetti alla Gricia

kosher salt, to taste
1 lb spaghetti
1 tbsp olive oil
7 oz guanciale, cut into 1 1/2x1/2" strips
1/2 c white wine
1 c grated pecorino romano + more for garnish
freshly ground black pepper to taste

Bring a large pot of water to a rolling boil over high heat. Season the water with salt. Add the pasta and cook until al dente, 9-11 min. Drain, reserving 1 c of the cooking liquid. Meanwhile, in a large skillet, heat the olive oil over medium heat. Add the guanciale and cook, turning often, until golden brown, 10-12 min. Add the white wine and cook until slightly reduced, 2 min. Pour in the reserved 1 c of cooking liquid and bring to a simmer. Add the pasta and the grated cheese and toss to coat. Cook, stirring vigorously, until a thick sauce forms, 2-3 min. Season with salt and pepper.
