  --America's Test Kitchen

Crust:
1 c (5 oz) ap flour
1/4 tsp salt
6 tbsp unsalted butter, cut into 6 pieces and softened
2 tsp water
1 tsp honey

Adjust oven rack to middle position and heat oven to 350F. Make foil sling for 8" square baking pan by folding 2 long sheets of foil so each is 8" wide. Lay sheets of foil in pan perpendicular to each other, with extra foil hanging over edges of pan. Push foil into corners and up sides of pan, smoothing foil flush to pan. Grease foil. Using stand mixer fitted with paddle, mix flour and salt on low speed until combined, ~30 s. Add butter, 1 piece at a time, and mix until only pea size pieces remain, ~1 min. Add water and honey and continue to mix until mixture begins to clump and resembles wet sand, ~30 s. Transfer mixture to prepared pan and press into even layer withbottom of dry measuring cup. Bake crust until golden brown, 20-25 min, rotating pan halfway through baking.  

Curd:
2 large eggs + 7 yolks
1/2 c honey
1/4 c grated lemon zest + 2/3 c juice (4 lemons)
1/8 tsp salt
4 tbsp unsalted butter, cut into 4 pieces
3 tbsp heavy cream

Whisk eggs, yolk, honey, lemon zest and juice, and salt together in medium saucepan until smooth. Cook over medium low heat, stirring constantly with rubber spatula, until mixture thickens slightly and registers 165 F, ~5-7 min. Off heat, whisk in butter until melted. Strain lemon curd through fine mesh strainer into bowl, then gently stir in cream with spatula. Pour warm curd over hot crust. Bake until filling is shiny and opaque and center jiggles slightly when shaken, 10-12 min, rotating pan halfway through baking. Let bars cool completely in pan, ~2 hrs. Using sling, lift bars from pan and transfer to cutting board. Cut into squares and serve.


Notes: cutting the sugar from 16 g per square to 9 g.
