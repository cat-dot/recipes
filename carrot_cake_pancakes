Carrot Cake Pancakes
  --Ryan Shelton
  
Pancakes:
1 tsp baking powder
1 c molasses sugar
1/4 c grapeseed oil
4 eggs
2 c ap flour
1 tsp salt
1 tsp ground cinnamon
1 1/2 c shredded raw carrot
1/2 c chopped walnuts
1/4 c milk (approx)
1/2 tsp baking soda

Mix together all the dry ingredients except the baking soda. Separately, mix all the wet ingredients except the milk. Mix the wet ingredients into the dry ingredients, whisking until smooth. Allow the mixture to rest in the refrigerator overnight. The next day, mix in the baking soda and just enough milk to create a pourable batter. Heat a cast iron pan over medium heat. Keeping pan oiled or buttered lightly, pour quarter-cup scoops of batter into the pan. Cook until browned and cooked through, flipping once. 

Stuffing:
1 c cream cheese
1 c whole milk ricotta
2 eggs
1/2 c powdered sugar
1 lemon, juiced

Mix all the ingredients in a food processor until smooth. Spread the mixture one to two inches thick in a small casserole dish, then cover with foil. Set the casserole in a larger casserole or baking pan and add one-half to one inch of hot water to the larger baking pan. Bake at 350F until just set in the center, about 30 min. Chill completely, or overnight before serving. 

Butter:
4 oz salted butter
1/3 c boiled carrot (until the texture is very soft)

Blend carrot in food processor, add butter, and blend until smooth.

Butterscotch:
1 c good quality maple syrup
1 c apple juice
3 tbsp butter
Lemon juice, as needed

Combine the maple syrup and apple juice in a small saucepan and reduce over medium heat until halved (~1 c should remain). Separately, brown the butter over medium heat. Combine butter and syrup; add a dash of lemon juice for a light tang.


Serve 2 pancakes with 2 small scoops of cream cheese stuffing and 1 dollop of carrot butter; drizzle with apple maple butterscotch and garnish with raw baby carrot curls.
