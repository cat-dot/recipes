Vegan 3-Bean Chili

1½ c red kidney beans
1½ c garbanzo beans
1½ c cannellini beans
3 tbsp olive oil
2 garlic cloves, minced
1 onion, finely chopped
1 jalapeño—stemmed, seeded and minced
2 tsp ground cumin
2 tsp smoked paprika
1 tsp ground coriander
½ tsp cayenne pepper
1 lb peeled butternut squash, cut into 1" cubes
28oz can fire-roasted crushed tomatoes
8 c water
Kosher salt, to taste
1½ c frozen corn kernels, thawed
1 c roasted red peppers, finely chopped
½ c minced cilantro
2 tbsp lime juice

In a large bowl, combine the red kidney, garbanzo and cannellini beans, and cover by at least 4" water. Cover with plastic wrap and let soak at room temp overnight. Drain the beans the next day. In a large pot, heat the olive oil over medium-high heat. Add the garlic, onion and jalapeño, and cook until softened and lightly golden, 3-4 min. Add the cumin, smoked paprika, coriander and cayenne, and stir until fragrant, 1 min. Stir in the butternut squash, followed by the crushed tomatoes, water and drained beans. Season with salt and bring to a simmer. Cook, partially covered until the beans and squash are tender and the broth is thickened, 1½ hrs. Remove from the heat and stir in the corn, red peppers, cilantro and lime juice. Adjust the seasoning with salt and serve.
