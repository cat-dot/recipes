Beer-soaked Tiramisu

2x12 oz bottles moddy tongue caramelized chocolate churro baltic porter
1/4 c strongly brewed coffee
3/4 c + 2 tbsp granulated sugar, divided
2/3 c whole milk
1 tsp kosher salt
6 egg yolks
2 c (1 lb) mascarpone cheese
1 1/4 c heavy cream
1/2 tsp vanilla
7 oz (24) ladyfingers, halved lengthwise
1 tbsp cocoa powder

In a medium saucepan, bring the beer to a simmer over medium high heat. Cook, stirring often, until reduced to 1/2 c, 20-25 min. Add the coffee and 3/4 c sugar, and stir until the sugar has dissolved, 1 min. Remove from the heat and let cool. In a small saucepan, bring the milk to a simmer over medium heat. Meanwhile, in a small bowl, whisk together the salt, remaning 2 tbsp sugar, and egg yolks until smooth. Whisk half the milk into the egg mixture to temper, then add the mixture back to the pot with the rest of the milk. Cook over medium heat, stirring constantly, until thickened, 2-3 min. Transfer to a bowl and cover the surface with plastic wrap, then let cool completely. Once cooled, stir in the mascarpone until incorporated. In a large bowl, whisk the heavy cream and vanilla to form stiff peaks. In a 9" springform pan, lay out half the ladyfingers, cut sides up. They will overlap slightly. Drizzle half the beer mixture over the ladyfingers. Using an offset spatula, spread half the mascarpone mixture in an even layer, followed by and even layer of half the wipped cream. Repeat this layering process, using up all of the components. Using a fine mesh sieve, dust the cocoa powder over the top then refrigerate until the cookies have softened and the tiramisu has set, 6 hrs to overnight. Using a paring knife, cut around the edge of the tiramisu to release, then remove the outer ring of the springform pan, slice and serve.
