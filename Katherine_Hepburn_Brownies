2 large eggs, lightly beaten
1/2 tsp vanilla
1/4 c ap flour

Place a rack in the center of the oven and preheat to 325F. Rub an 8" square baking pan with butter an dust with flour. Shake out excess flour and set the pan aside. Place the chocolate and butter in a large heavy saucepan over low heat. Stir until the chocolate and butter melt, 4-5 min. Remove the pan from the heat and stir in sugar. Add the eggs and vanilla and stir to combine well. Add the flour, salt, and walnuts. Stir just to combine. Turn the batter into the prepared pan, and place in the oven. Bake until a toothpick inserted in the center comes out with moist and fudgy crumbs, 35-40 min. Remove the pan and place on wire rack to cool completely, ~1 hr.
