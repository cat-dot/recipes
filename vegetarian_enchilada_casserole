Vegetarian Enchilada Casserole  - gf
  --Carol Hilderbrand

15 oz can black beans, rinsed and drained
2 cloves garlic, minced
1 onion, chopped
4 oz can diced green chile peppers
1 jalapeno pepper, seeded and minced
9 oz package tempeh, crumbled
6x6" corn tortillas
19 oz can enchilada sauce (or homemade)
6 oz can sliced black olives
8 oz shredded cheddar cheese

Preheat oven to 350F/175C. Lightly oil 9x13" baking dish. In a medium bowl, combine the beans, garlic, onion, chile peppers, jalapeno pepper, and tempeh. Pour enchilada sauce into a shallow bowl. Dip 3 tortillas into sauce and place into bottom of prepared baking dish, covering as completely as possible. Place 1/2 of the bean mixture on top and repeat. Drizzle remaining sauce over the top and sprinkle with olives and cheese. Cover and bake for 30 min. Uncover and continue baking for 15 more min or until bubbling and cheese is melted.


Notes: Add additional seasoning to bean mixture - cumin, oregano, chile powder, red pepper flakes, etc. Add more beans (pinto) and corn. Can add more cheese on first layer. Use more tortillas (9) and cut/rip to fill layer. Saute onions and peppers before combining with beans as they don't cook that much inside the casserole.
