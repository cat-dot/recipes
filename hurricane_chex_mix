  --Joellen, Cupacocoa; see also www.foodgeeks.com

2 sticks (1 c) butter
3/4 c light corn syrup, such as Karo’s
2 tsp shoyu
3/4 c vegetable oil
1 c sugar
12 oz box Rice Chex cereal
12 oz box Corn Chex cereal
Optional: pretzels (8 oz.)
2x 1.7 oz Furikake

Heat butter, karo syrup, soy sauce and oil in a pot. Remove from burner and add sugar, stirring until sugar dissolves. Whisk until mixture is smooth and completely combined. Pour cereal into two large tin foil pans. Pour mixture over cereal, mixing well until cereal is lightly coated. Sprinkle furikake over mixture, mix, and bake at 250F for 1 hr, stirring every 15 min. Remove from oven, and stir again after a few minutes so the pieces don’t stick together while cooling. Once cooled, snack away! 


Notes: This recipe is very "loose" can add honeycomb, nuts, arare, different chex, bugles, etc. Can sub honey for corn syrup, add in worcestershire (up to 2 tbsp)
       To make spucy, can add 1 tsp tobasco OR 1 tbsp chili powder + 1/4 tsp cayenne - really play with it
