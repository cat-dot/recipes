Vegetarian Mushroom Meat Loaf

4 oz sourdough bread, sliced and crust removed
1 c almond milk
3 tbsp olive oil + mor for greasing
1 yellow onion, finely chopped
2 lbs mixed mushrooms, finely chopped
1 c ketchup, divided
1 tbsp minced sage
1 tbsp minced thyme
1 tbsp minced oregano
2 garlic cloves, minced
1 c walnuts, coarsely ground in a food processor
1/2 c instant oats
1/2 c dry bread crumbs
2 tbsp kosher salt
2 tbsp lemon juice
1/2 tbsp freshly ground black pepper
1 tsp lemon zest
2 eggs, lightly beaten

Preheat oven to 375F. In a small bowl, cover the sourdough with the almond milk. Let soak for 15 min, then squeeze the bread to release any soaked milk, tear into 1" pieces and set aside. In a 6 quart dutch oven, heat the oil over medium high heat. Add the onions and cook until lightly caramelized, 3-4 min. Add the mushrooms and cook, stirring often, until any liquid released has evaporated and the mushrooms are lightly caramelized, 10-12 min. Add half of the ketchup with the sage, thyme, oregano, and garlic, and cook, scraping up any brown bits from the bottom of the pot, until the garlic and herbs are fragrant, 2 min. Remove from the heat and stir in the reserved bread, walnuts, oats, and bread crumbs. Transfer to a large bowl and let cool slightly. Using a wooden spoon, stir in the salt, lemon juice, pepper, lemon zest, and eggs until well incorporated. Press the mixture into a greased 9x5" loaf pan and smooth the top. Brush with the remaining ketchup. Bake the loaf for 1hr, then place on a wire rack to cool for 20 min before slicing and serving.
