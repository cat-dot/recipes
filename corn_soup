Chilled Corn Soup with Pickled Corn

Pickled Corn
2 c corn kernel (~2 cobs)
1 small shallot, julienned
1 chile pepper (serano, jalapeno, etc) seeded and thinly sliced
1 garlic clove, very thinly sliced
1/2 c white wine vinegar
2 tsp kosher salt
1 1/2 tsp sugar
1 tsp crushed coriander seeds
1 c water

In a heatproof 1 quart jar, combine the corn, shallots, chile pepper, and garlic. In a medium sauce pan over medium-high heat, bring the vinegar, salt, sugar, and coriander to a boil. Pour the vinegar and water over the corn mixture. Seal and wipe the lid and let cool. Refrigerate until chilled. Will keep for up to 1 month.

Soup
6 corn cobs, kernels removed and reserved
4 black peppercorns
3 parsel stems
3 thyme sprigs
1 fresh bay leaf
10 c water
1/4 c olive oil + more for drizzling
2 medium yellow onions, halved and thinly sliced
kosher salt to taste

In a large pot, add the corn cobs, peppercorns, herbs, and water. Bring to a boil, then reduce the heat to medium and simmer for 45 min or until you have 5 c. Strain the stock and set aside. Wipe the pot clean, then add the olive oil and place over medium heat. When the oil is warm, add the onions. Season with salt and cook, stirring occasionally until the onions are soft but not brown, 8-10 min. Add the reserved corn kernels and cook for 2-3 min. Add the corn stock, bring to a boil then reduce the heat back to medium. Simmer until the corn is tender, 10 min. Remove from the heat. Discard the thyme sprigs and bay leaf. Working in batches, puree the corn soup in a blender until smooth, then strain the mixture through a sieve into a large bowl. Season with salt and refrigerate until chilled, 4hrs. To serve, spoon 2 tbsp of the pickled corn into the bottom of 6 bowls. Pour the corn soup over the pickled corn and drizzle with olive oil.
