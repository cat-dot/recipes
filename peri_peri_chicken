2 tbsp evoo
1 tbsp salt
1 tbsp tomato paste
2 tsp sugar
1 1/2 tsp paprika
1 1/2 tsp 5 spice powder

1 tsp grated lemon zest + 2 tbsp juice + 2 wedges for serving
1/2 tsp pepper
1/4 tsp cayenne pepper

Process arbols, shallot, oil, salt, tomato paste, sugar, paprika, 5 spice powder, garlic powder, lemon zest and juice, pepper, cayenne, and bay leaves in blender until smooth, scraping down sides of blender jar as needed, ~1 min. Place chicken and chile paste in 1 gallon zip top freezer bag and toss to coat. Seal bag, pressing out as much air as possible. Refrigerate chicken for at least 6 hr or up to 24 hr. Using sous vide, bring water to 150F/65.5C in 7 qt container. Gently lower bag into water until chicken is fully submerged, and then clip top corner of bag to side of water bath container, allowing remaining aire bubbles to rise to top of bag. Reopen 1 corner of zipper, release remaining air bubbles, and reseal bag. Cover and cook chicken for at least 1 1/2 hr or up to 3 hr. Adjust oven rack 6" from broiler element and heat broiler. Set wire rack in aluminum foil lined rimmed baking sheet and spray with vegetable oil spray. Transfer chicken skin side up to prepared rack and let rest while preparing sauce. Pour accumulated juices into 8" skillet, bring to simmer over medium heat, and cook until reduced by 2/3, 3-5 min. Brush chicken with sauce and broil until skin is crisp and lightly charred, 6-8 min. Serve with lemon wedges.
Chicken can be made ahead, chill in ice bath after sous vide and refrigerate for up to 5 days. To reheat, place sealed bag in water bath set to 150F for 20 min, proceed with reducing juices and broiling.


Notes: If you can find peri peri chiles, use those instead of arbol, use less chiles for less spicy.
