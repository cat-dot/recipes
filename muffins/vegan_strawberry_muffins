  --Sarah McMinn

1 c soy milk
1 tsp apple cider vinegar
2 c ap flour
2 1/2 tsp baking powder
1/4 tsp baking soda
1/2 tsp salt
1/2 c + 2 tbsp sugar
1/4 c + 2 tbsp canola oil
1 tsp vanilla
zest of 1 lemon
1 heaping c fresh strawberries sliced thin

Preheat the oven to 375F. Spray a muffin tin with cooking spray and set aside. In a small bowl combine soy milk and apple cider vinegar. Set aside to allow milk to curdle. In a larger bowl combine flour, baking powder, baking soda, and salt. Set aside. In a separate bowl, mix together sugar, canola oil, lemon zest, and vanilla extract. Add soy milk/vinegar mixture and stir to combine. Stir in the dry ingredients until well incorporated. Be careful not to over-mix - a few lumps are okay. Gently fold in the strawberries. Spoon into muffin tins, filling each cup about Â¾ full. Bake for 20-22 min until a knife inserted in the middle comes out clean. Remove from the oven and allow muffins to cool before removing from pan.

Notes: can be made with gf flour 1:1
