Muffins:
1 c sliced or slivered toasted almonds
1 c whole rolled oats
1 1/2 c ap flour
1 c firmly packed dark brown sugar
2 tsp baking soda
1 tsp ground cinnamon
1/2 tsp baking powder
1/2 tsp salt
1/2 c vegetable oil

Preheat oven to 375F. Place muffin liners in muffin pan. Add almonds and rolled oats to the blender and blend on low. Gradually increase the speed to high and blend until almonds and oats are finely ground, ~20 s. Use tamper as needed to move the mixture while blending. Transfer mixture to a large bowl. Add flour, brown sugar, baking soda, cinnamon, baking powder, and salt. Whisk to combine and set aside. Add oil, sour cream or yogurt, and apples to the blender. Blend on low and gradually increase the speed to medium and blend until smooth, ~20 s. Add eggs and vanilla and pulse to combine. Transfer apple mixture to bowl with dry ingredients and stir until just combined. Pour batter into muffin cups, filling almost completely full. Bake until tops are browned and tester inserted into the center comes out clean, 16-18 min. Transfer to cooling rack and allow to cool completely.

8 oz cream cheese softened
1/2 tsp vanilla
1 c powdered sugar
zest of 1 lemon

In a medium bowl, combine all ingredients. Stir with a fork or small whisk until smooth. Spread ~1 tbsp per muffin. Sprinkle with additional toasted almonds, if desired.
