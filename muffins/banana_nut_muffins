  --Chrissie Baker, the busy baker
  
Muffins:
3 large ripe bananas
3/4 c sugar
1 large egg
1/3 c vegetable oil
1 1/2 c ap flour
1 tsp baking powder
1 tsp baking soda
1/2 tsp salt
1/2 tsp cinnamon
1/4 tsp nutmeg
3/4 c chopped walnuts

Preheat oven to 350F and prep 12 c muffin tin with paper liners (or heavily greased). Mash bananas in a large bowl and mix in the suager and egg with a wooden spoon until well blended. Add oil and mix well. Add flour, baking powder, baking soda, salt, cinnamon, and nutmeg, along with the walnuts. Mix everything together just until the flour disappears and the walnuts are evenly distributed throughout the batter. 

Topping:
3/4 c chopped walnuts
2 tbsp brown sugar
1 tbsp melted butter

Combine all ingredients in a small bowl until the walnuts are well coated. Spoon batter evenly into the prepared tin and spoon a bit of the topping onto the top of each one, making sure the topping is well distributed 
on the top of each muffin. Bake for ~20-23 min, or until the muffins are golden brown on top and a toothpick inserted in the center comes out clean. Let the muffins cool in the tin for a few minutes before removing them to a wire rack to cool completely.


Notes: Can be stored in an airtight container at room temp for up to 4 days. Can freeze for up to 2 months. Can sub applesauce for the oil if desired.
