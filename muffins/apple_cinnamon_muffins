Topping:
2 tbsp sugar
2 tbsp packed brown sugar
1/4 tsp cinnamon

Using your fingers, combine all ingredients in bowl. Cover and set aside.

Muffins:
2 tbsp unsalted butter + 4 tbsp melted
2 granny smith apples (6 1/2 oz each) peeled, cored, and cut into 1/4" pieces (3 c)
2 tbsp packed brown sugar
3/4 tsp cinnamon, divided
2 1/2 c (12 1/2 oz) ap flour
2 1/2 tsp baking powder
1/4 tsp baking soda
1 1/4 tsp salt
1 c (7 oz) sugar
2 large eggs
1/4 c vegetable oil
1/2 c apple cider
1/2 c plain whole milk yogurt
1 tsp vanilla

Adjust oven rack to upper middle position and heat oven to 400F. Spray 12 c muffin tin generously with vegetable oil spray. Melt 2 tbsp butter in 12" skillet over medium high heat. Add apples, brown sugar, and 1/4 tsp cinnamon. Cook, stirring often, until moisture has completely evaporated and apples are well browned, ~9 min. Remove pan from heat and let cool for 10 min. Meanwhile, whisk flour, baking powder, baking soda, salt, and remaining 1/2 tsp cinnamon together in large bowl. Whisk sugar, eggs, oil, and remaining 4 tbsp melted butter together in separate bowl until thick and homogeneous, ~30 s. Whisk cider, yogurt, and vanilla into sugar mixture until combined. Fold sugar mixture and cooled apples into flour mixture until just combined. Using greased 1/3 c dry measuring cup, divide batter evenly among prepared muffin cups; sprinkle muffin tops evenly with topping. Bake until golden brown and toothpick inserted in center comes out with few crumbs attached, 18-22 min, rotating muffin tin halfway through baking. Let muffins cool in muffin tin on wire rack for 10 min. Remove muffins from tin and let cool for 5 min on rack. Serve.
