Strawberry Muffins
  --Katie Mae (and her reviewers)

1/4 c vegetable oil
1/2 c milk
1 egg
1/2 tsp vanilla
1/2 tsp salt
2 tsp baking powder
1/2 c sugar
1/4 c brown sugar
1 1/2 c ap flour
1/2 tsp cinnamon (optional)
1 c chopped strawberries
1 c chocolate chips (optional)

Preheat oven to 375F (190C); prep muffin tin (oil or papers). Combine oil, milk, vanilla, and egg in small bowl; beat lightly. In large bowl, combine the rest of the ingredients except strawberries, mix well. Toss strawberries (and chocolate if using) in flour mixture to coat, then add wet ingredients and stir until just combined. Portion out into muffin tin. Bake for 25 min or until tops bounce back from the touch. Cool 10 min, then remove from pan. Makes 8-10 muffins

Notes: after cutting up strawberries,  sprinkle them with sugar and let them sit for about an hour. You still get definite bites of berry, but the texture is not so mushy. Can add pulverized oats and/or wheat germ, maybe sub some nut flour for the ap flour. Can also make into a 9x5" loaf.
