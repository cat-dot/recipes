Green Juice and Muffins

4 ribs celery
2 granny smith apples, halved and cored
1 kirby cucumber, halved lengthwise
2" piece ginger, peeled
1/2 bunch (1 c packed) parsley leaves and stems roughly chopped

In a juicer process the celery, apples, cucumber, ginger, and parsley, reserving the pulp. 

Muffins:
3/4 c ap flour
1/2 c whole wheat pastry flour
1 1/2 tsp baking powder
1/2 tsp salt
1/2 c sunflower oil
1/3 c honey
1 tsp lemon zest
2 eggs
1 c packed juice pulp
1/4 c pepitas

Preheat the oven to 350F. Grease a muffin pan or line with baking cups. In a medium bowl, whisk together the flours, baking powder, and salt. In another bowl, whisk the oil, honey, lemon zest, and eggs until smooth. Slowly fold the dry ingredients into the wet until just incorporated. Stir in the juice pulp and divide the batter between the 12 muffin cups, ~ 1/4 c batter per cup. Sprinkle pepitas over each muffin. Bake until a toothpick inserted in the middle comes out clean, ~ 20min. Let cool completely.
