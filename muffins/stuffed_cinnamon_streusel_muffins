Stuffed Cinnamon Streusel Muffins
  --PJ Hamel

Topping:
1/4 c (28g) pecans, diced
1/4 c (23g) rolled oats, old-fashioned or quick-cooking*
1/2 c (60g) ap flour
1/2 tsp cinnamon, optional; for added cinnamon flavor
3 tbsp (42g) butter, softened
1/3 c (71g) light brown sugar or dark brown sugar, packed

In a small bowl, mix together all the ingredients together until crumbly. Set aside.

Filling:
1/3 c (71g) light brown sugar, packed
2 tbsp (25g)  sugar
2 tbsp (14g) Kap flour
2 tsp cinnamon
1/4 tsp table salt
1 tbsp (14g) unsalted butter, melted
1 tbsp (14g) water, lukewarm

In a small bowl, whisk together the sugars, flour, cinnamon, and salt. Add the butter and water and continue whisking until the mixture is well combined. Set aside.

Batter:
8 tbsp (113g) unsalted butter, melted
3/4 c (170g) milk, lukewarm
2 large eggs
1 3/4 c (210g) ap flour
1/2 c (45g) rolled oats, old-fashioned or quick-cooking*
2 tbsp (14g) cornstarch, optional; for added tenderness
3/4 c (149g) sugar
1 tbsp baking powder
1/2 tsp salt
1/4 tsp nutmeg
1/2 c (85g) cinnamon chips, butterscotch chips, or King Arthur Cinnamon Sweet Bits, optional

Preheat your oven to 400F. Line a 12-cup muffin pan with baking cups, or grease it lightly. In a bowl or large measuring cup, whisk together the melted butter, milk, and eggs. In a separate bowl, whisk together the dry ingredients, including the chips. Add the liquid mixture to the dry ingredients, stirring just until combined. Divide half the batter evenly among the muffin cups, filling them a little more than halfway full. Dollop 2 tsp of the filling onto each muffin; a tsp cookie scoop, filled level, works well here. Top with the remaining batter. Use an offset spatula or the back of a spoon to spread the batter over an exposed filling, covering it completely. Sprinkle generously with the topping, pressing it in lightly. Bake for 20-25 min or until the tops of the muffins are golden brown. Remove the muffins from the oven, and wait 5 min before transferring them from the pan to a rack to cool.


Glaze (optional):
2/3 c (74g) confectioners' sugar
pinch of salt
1 tbsp (14g) milk, or enough to make a pourable glaze

In a small bowl (re-use the bowl that had the topping in it to reduce clean up), mix the glaze ingredients together until smooth. Drizzle over the cooled muffins and serve warm, or cool a rack and then enjoy.
