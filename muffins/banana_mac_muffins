Banana Macadamia Nut Muffins
  --America's Test Kitchen

1 lb very ripe bananas (~4)
2 eggs
1/3 c vegetable oil
1/2 c sugar
2 tsp vanilla
1 2/3 c bread flour
1/2 tsp baking soda
1 tbsp baking powder
1/2 tsp salt
1/3 c toasted macadamia nuts, roughly chopped
1/3 c toasted sweetened coconut flakes

Preheat oven to 425F. Mash bananas in a medium bowl. Add eggs, oil, sugar, and vanilla and whisk to combine. Combine mac nuts and coconut in a small bowl, reserving 2 tbsp for topping. In another bowl, add flour, baking soda, baking powder, and salt, whisk to combine. Pour dry ingredients into wet, add mac nut mixture and stir until dry ingredients are integrated. Portion out into greased muffin tin and sprinkle the tops with 1 tbsp sugar and reserved macnut mixture. Bake for 14-18 min, until a toothpick inserted into the center of a muffin comes out clean. Cool in muffin tin for 10 min, then put muffins on rack and cool for another 5 before serving.




Notes: can play around with other add-ins in place of the coconut and macnuts.
