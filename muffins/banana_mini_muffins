Banana Mini Muffins
  --Amy's Healthy Baking

1 1/4 c (325g) mashed very ripe bananas (~2 large or 4 small)
1/2 tbsp (7g) coconut oil or stick-style vegan butter, melted
2 tsp vanilla 
1 tsp liquid stevia
1/4 tsp salt
3 tbsp (45mL) plain white distilled vinegar
1/2 c + 2 tbsp (150mL) unsweetened vanilla almond milk
2 1/4 c (270g) white whole wheat flour or gf flour
1 1/2 tsp baking powder
3/4 tsp baking soda

Preheat the oven to 350F. Coat 36 mini muffin cups with nonstick cooking spray. If using liners, then line 36 mini muffin cups with paper liners, and coat the liners with cooking spray. In a medium bowl, stir together the banana, coconut oil, vanilla, stevia, and salt. Stir in the vinegar. Stir in the milk. Add the flour. Sprinkle the baking powder and baking soda on top of the flour (to avoid clumps and make sure the muffins bake evenly!). Stir until just incorporated. Divide the batter between the prepared paper liners. Bake for 12-15 min or until the centers feel firm to the touch and a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean or with a few crumbs attached. Cool in the pan for 5 min before transferring to a wire rack to cool completely. 


Notes: Measure the mashed banana by grams or by cups — NOT by bananas! Not all “medium” or “small” bananas are the same size. If you prefer not to use stevia, substitute 1/2 c (180mL) of pure maple syrup, agave, or honey for the liquid stevia AND reduce the milk to 2 tbsp (30mL) if using any of those liquid sweeteners. Alternatively, substitute 1/2 c (96g) of coconut sugar, brown sugar, or granulated sugar in place of the liquid stevia AND reduce the milk to 6 tbsp (90mL). Any milk may be substituted for the unsweetened vanilla almond milk. To make standard sized muffins, coat 12 muffin papers with non-stick and bake for 18-22 min. 


gf blend: 1 c (120g) millet flour, 3/4 c (90g) tapioca flour, 1/2 c (60g) brown rice flour, and 1 1/2 tsp xanthan gum.
