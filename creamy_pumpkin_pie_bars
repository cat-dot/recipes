Creamy Pumkpin Pie Bars - Vegan + gf
  --Minimalist Baker

Crust:
1 c (90g) gf rolled oats
1 1/2 c (168g) almond flour (or 1 c raw almonds)
1/4 tsp salt
2 tbsp (24g) coconut sugar
1 tbsp (15ml) maple syrup
4-5 tbsp (60-65ml) melted coconut oil

Preheat oven to 350F and line a 8x8" baking dish with parchment paper. Add oats to blender/food processor and blend until you reach oat flour consistency; if using raw almonds, blend with oats. Add almond flour, salt, sugar, and mix. Then add syrup, oil, and mix/pulse to combine. Depending on device, may need to scrape the sides to ensure everything is completely mixed. Add more coconut oil if it appears too dry. Add crust to prepared dish and shake to evenly disperse, then lay down parchment on top and use a flat bottomed object to pack the crust into place, making an even, firmly packed layer. Bake for 20 min, then set aside to cool.

Filling:
2 3/4 c (475g) pumpkin puree
1/4 c (60ml) maple syrup
1/4 c (48g) coconut sugar
1/4 c (60g) unsweetened plain almond milk
2 1/2 tbsp (18g) cornstarch
1 3/4 tsp pumpkin pie spice (mix of ginger, cinnamon, nutmeg, & cloves)
1/4 tsp salt

Add all filling ingredients to the blender/food processor and blend until smooth, scraping down the sides as needed. Taste and adjust seasonings. Set aside. Once crust is cooled, pour filling into the crust and tap on the counter to remove air bubbles. Bake for 50 min - 1 hr. The filling will be just a bit jiggly, dark orange in color, and have some cracks on the top. Remove from oven and let cool completely before loosely covering with plastic wrap or foil and transferring to the refrigerator to fully set, 4-6 hrs or overnight (preferred).
