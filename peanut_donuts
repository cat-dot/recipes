Peanut Flour Donut - gf
  --Jessica Kellgren-Fozard

Donuts:
60g (1/2 c) peanut flour
30g (1/4 c) granulated sugar substitute
110g (1/2 c) melted unsalted butter
3 eggs
55g (1/4 c) coconut milk
1 tsp vanilla
1/4 tsp baking powder
1/4 tsp salt

Preheat oven to 180C. Mix dry ingredients; then add eggs, milk, butter, and vanilla; blend until there are no lumps. Grease donut tin with butter before pouring in mixture. Bake for 20 min or until firm. Allow to cool before removing from tin. Makes 12 mini or 5-6 regular sized donuts.

Topping:
2 tbsp coconut oil
30g cream cheese

Mix together and spread on cooled donuts.


Notes: If you have a peanut allergy or just don't like it, can substitute rice or sesame flour (though sesame flour gives a runnier mixture)
