Spinach Saffron Dip

1/4 tsp saffron threads
2 garlic cloves, minced
10 oz package frozen spinach, finely chopped, thawed, and squeezed dry
16 oz cream cheese, softened
2 tbsp unsalted butter, softened
1 1/2 c (2oz) finely grated parmesan using a microplane
1 tbsp finely chopped basil
1 tsp finely chopped dill + more for garnish
1/4 tsp freshly ground black pepper
1/2 tsp dried marjoram
2 tbsp lemon juice
1 tbsp lemon zest
salt to taste

In a small bowl, pour 2 tsp of hot water over the saffron. Steep until the water has turned a deep and unmistakable orange, ~15 min. In a large mixing bowl, combine all of the remaining ingredients along with the saffron. Season with salt and stir using a rubber spatula until well combined. For a creamier consistency, transfer the dip to a food processor and pulse until smooth. Garnish with more dill and serve with veggies.
