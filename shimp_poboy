Shrimp Po'boys

1 lbs medium peeled and deveined shrimp
1 c buttermilk
¼ c Crystal hot sauce, divided
1 tbsp kosher salt, plus more to taste
1 c ap flour
¾ c yellow cornmeal
½ tsp cayenne pepper
½ tsp dried oregano
½ tsp dried thyme
½ tsp garlic powder
½ tsp freshly ground black pepper
¼ c mayonnaise
Vegetable oil, for frying
Two 10" po'boy rolls or French hero rolls, halved lengthwise
1 beefsteak tomato, thinly sliced
1 shredded iceberg lettuce
2 tbsp thinly sliced cornichons, for garnish

In a medium bowl, toss the shrimp in the buttermilk, 2 tbsp of hot sauce and 1/2 tbsp of the salt. Cover with plastic wrap and refrigerate for 1 hr. Meanwhile, in another medium bowl, whisk together the remaining 1/2 tbsp of salt with the flour, cornmeal, caynenne, oregano, thyme, garlic powder, and pepper, and set aside. In a small bowl, whisk together the remaining 2 tbsp of the hot sauce with the mayo until smooth, and set aside. In a medium dutch oven, heat 2" of oil to 350F and line a plate with paper towels. Drain the shrimp well before tossing them in the flour mixture to coat well. Working in batches, fry the shrimp until golden brown and cooked through, 1 min. Using a metal spider, transfer the shrimp to the prepared plate to drain, immediately seasoning with salt. Let the oil return to temp between batches. Spread the mayo mixture on both halves of the rolls. On the bottom halves, divide the fried shrimp, top with the sliced tomatoes, shredded lettuce, and sliced cornichons. Top with the other halves, slice and serve.
