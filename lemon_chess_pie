Lemon Chess Pie
  --Cook's country
  
5 large eggs
1 3/4 + 1 tsp sugar
1 tbsp grated lemon zest
3 tbsp lemon juice
2 tbsp cornmeal
1/4 sp salt
8 tbsp (1 stick) unsalted butter, melted and cooled slightly
9" pie shell 

Whisk eggs in large bowl until smooth. Slowly whisk in 1 3/4 c sugar, zest, juice, cornmeal, and salt until combined. Whisk in butter. Poke pie shell all over with fork. Refrigerate 40 min, then freeze 20 min. Adjust oven rack to upper middle position and heat oven to 450F. Bake shell until small bubbles appear and surface begins to look dry, ~8 min. Remove from oven. Reduce temp to 325F. Whisk pie filling briefly to recombine. Scrape filling into prepared pie shell and bake until surface is light brown and center jiggles slightly when shaken, 35-40 min. Sprinkle with remaining sugar. Cool completely on wire rack, ~4 hrs. Serve. Pie can be refrigerated for 2 days.


Notes: Make filling before baking shell so the cornmeal has time to soften. Adding the filling when the shell is still warm reduces cooking time slightly.
