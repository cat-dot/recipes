Trinidad Chicken Stew

2 lbs boneless, skinless chicken thighs, cut into 2" pieces
1 large tomato finely chopped
1 medium yellow onion finely chopped
2 medium peeled garlic cloves finely chopped
12 scallions, thinly sliced on a bias (~3/4 c)
1/2 large bunch of cilantro; 1/4 finely chopped (~3tbsp); the remaining 1/4 whole leaves (~1/4 c)
20 sprigs fresh thyme, leaves picked from stems and finely chopped ~ 1 tbsp
1 tbsp + 1 1/2 tsp fine sea salt
2 tsp freshly ground black pepper
1/4 tsp sweet paprika
1/4 c grapeseed oil
2 tbsp lightly packed light brown sugar
3 c chicken broth
1 15oz can pinto beans, drained and rinsed
4 c cooked long-grain brown rice
sriracha for serving


In a large mixing bowl, add: chicken thighs, tomato, onion, garlic, 1/2 c of the sliced scallions, chopped cilantro, thyme, salt, pepper, paprika; combine using a wooden spoon and set aside for 10 min. In a large pot over medium heat, add the oil. Once the oil begins to shimmer (~2 min), add the sugar. Stir occasionally until the sugar begins to bubble and turn into a dark brown caramel, 2-4 min. Add the chicken to the pot, stirring occasionally to brown the chicken, 7-12 min. Add the chicken broth and bring to a boil over high heat, then reduce the temp to medium-low. Stir in the beans, cook until they are warmed through, ~ 15min. Turn off the heat and use a ladle or slotted spoon to transfer the chicken to a serving dish. Serve the stew over the rice, sprinkle the cilantro leaves, remaining scallions.
