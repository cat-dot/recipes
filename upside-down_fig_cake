Upside-down Fig Cake
  --Nik Sharma

12-14 medium fresh figs (~1 lb)
4 tbsp ghee, divided
3/4 c sugar, divided
1/8 tsp cream of tartar
1/4 c maple syrup
1 c ap flour
1 tsp baking powder
1/4 tsp baking soda
1/4 tsp fine salt
4 oz unsalted butter, room temp
2 large eggs, room temp
seeds from 4 green cardamom pods, ground

Preheat oven to 325F. Grease and line a circular 9" baking pan with 2 tbsp ghee and parchment paper. Cut the tops off 8 to 9 figs. Slice each one lengthwise into 4 equal slices. Cover the surface of the greased pan with the fig slices. Chop the remaining figs and set aside in a small bowl. In a small saucepan, heat ¼ c of the sugar, cream of tartar and 2 tbsp water on medium-high heat until the sugar just starts to caramelize and starts to turn a light amber color. Drizzle the hot liquid over the sliced figs in the pan. Then drizzle the maple syrup over the figs. Set aside. In a medium bowl, whisk the flour, cardamom, baking powder, baking soda and salt. Set aside. Take 2 tbsp of the dry mixture and sprinkle it over the chopped figs in the small bowl. Toss to coat evenly. In the bowl of a stand mixer using the paddle attachment, cream the butter, remaining 2 tbsp ghee and remaining ½ c of sugar on medium-high speed for about 3-4 min, until light and fluffy. Whisk in one egg at a time, until combined. Scrape the sides of the bowl. Add the dry ingredients to the bowl and mix on low speed until just combined. Fold in the chopped figs with a silicone spatula. Transfer the batter to the cake pan and spread it evenly using an offset spatula. Bake in the preheated oven for 55-60 min, or until a skewer comes out clean from the center. Once baked, remove it from the oven and allow to cool for 10 min in the pan over a wire rack. To release the cake, run a knife around the edges of the cake and then place a serving plate over the baking dish, then carefully invert the cake over the plate and remove the pan. Peel the parchment paper off.
