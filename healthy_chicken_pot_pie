  --Clean Plates
  
3/4 c spelt flour
1/2 c + 2 tbsp whole wheat flour, divided
8 tbsp butter
2-4 tbsp ice water
1 1/2 tbsp olive oil
1 1/2 c chicken breast, 1/2"  dice
2 c broccoli, 1/2" dice
1 c onion, in 1/2" dice
1 c sweet potato, 1/2" dice
1 c celery, 1/2" dice
1 c carrots, 1/2" dice
1 c peas
1 1/2 tbsp garlic, minced (~4 cloves)
1 tbsp fresh sage, minced
1 tsp fresh thyme, minced
2 tbsp whole wheat flour
1 tbsp white flour
1 tbsp tamari
1/2 tsp ground black pepper
1/2 tsp salt
1 1/4 c chicken stock
3/4 c milk (dairy or non dairy)
1 tbsp parsley, minced

Directions
In a food processor, add spelt flour, 1/2 c of whole wheat flour, and butter. Pulse until pea-sized crumbles form. With the blade running, add water one tbsp at a time, waiting at least 5 s after each addition. As soon as the mixture is spinning in one piece, stop the processor and remove the dough. Pat into a circle in plastic wrap, and refrigerate. Heat a 12" cast iron pan over medium high heat and add olive oil. Once shimmering, add the chicken, all of the vegetables, and the sage and thyme. Saute for 3 min, stirring occasionally. Add 2 tbsp wheat flour and the white flour, and stir well so that the flours disperse throughout the chicken and vegetables. Saute for an additional 3 min. Add the tamari sauce, salt, pepper, stock, and milk, and bring to a boil. Once boiling, reduce to medium and stir occasionally for 15 min, until the sauce has thickened and the vegetables and chicken are cooked. Remove from the heat. Let the filling cool in the pan for 30 min while the dough chills. Preheat your oven to 350 F. Once the dough has been in the fridge for 1 hr, remove it and roll it out on a floured surface into a large enough circle to aptly cover the cast iron pan. Using the rolling pin for help, lay the top crust over the filling and press so that it is sealed around the pan. You can scallop the edges, or leave them plain. Cut at least two small slits in the center so that steam can escape. Bake for 45-50 min, until the crust is a dark golden brown. Let cool for 10 min before serving.
