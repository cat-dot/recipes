  --Lentine Alexis

2 c (256g) ap flour
2 tsp baking soda
2 tsp ground ginger
1 1/2 tsp cinnamon
1 1/2 tsp chinese 5 spice
1/2 tsp fine grain sea salt
4 oz (113g) unsalted butter, melted and still warm
1/4 c (80g) unsulfured moleasses
1/2 c (99g) sugar
1/3 c (68g) packed brown sugar
2 tbsp fresh ginger, finely grated
1 large egg
3/4 c (170g) crystillized ginger, finely diced
1/2 c (99g) turbinado sugar, optional

Position racks in the upper and lower thirds of the oven, heat to 350F (176C); line 2 baking sheets with parchment paper and set aside. In a medium bowl, combine flour, baking soda, spices, and salt and whisk to mix completely. In a large bowl, combine the butter, moleasses, sugars, fresh ginger, and egg, mixing completely. Add the flour mix and the crystillized ginger and stir until completely incorporated. The dough will be rather soft but not wet. Using teaspoon or small dough scoop, form dough into 1" balls. Roll balls in turbinado sugar (if using) and place 2" apart on prepared sheets. Bake until they puff up and crack on the surface, then begin to deflate, ~10-12 min. For most even baking ,rotate sheets from top to bottom and back to front halfway through. If you prefer crunchier cookies, leave in 1-2 min longer. Allow cookies to cool on the pan for a couple of mintes before transferring to wire rack to cool completely. Stor in an airtight container for up to 4 days. Makes 16 cookies.
