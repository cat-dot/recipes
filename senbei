Senbei
  --Ivy Manning

3/4 c sweet rice flour (such as Bobâ€™s Red Mill Sweet Rice Flour)
1/3 c cooked white rice
1/4 tsp sea salt
2 tbsp canola oil
4 tbsp water
5 tsp furikake
1 tbsp aged soy sauce
1 tbsp tupelo honey

Preheat oven to 350F. In a food processor, combine the rice flour, white rice, salt, and oil. Pulse until finely ground. With the machine running, slowly add the water. Transfer to a bowl, add the furikake, and knead to combine. Press hazelnut-sized balls of the dough between 2 ziplock bags into 2 1/2" disks (I use a flat-bottom brulee dish); the dough will be very thin. Bake on rimmed baking sheets for 5 min. Flip the crackers with a spatula and continue to cook until they are dry and starting to brown, 4-5 more min. Remove from oven. Turn off oven. Combine the soy sauce and honey in a small bowl. Microwave for 25 s. Brush the tops of each cracker with the soy mixture. Place crackers in turned off oven and allow them to dry for 3 min. Allow crackers to cool for 15 minutes; they will crisp up considerably. Store in airtight container.


Notes: Makes 30 crackers
 If you like the puffier texture of Japanese senbei, you can roll the dough into ropes, slice it, steam it for 30 min and then bake it
