Chocolate Truffle Torte
  --Megan Giller

15 oz chocolate (65-80%) chopped
7 oz butter, chopped
5 eggs
2 tbsp water
1/2 c sugar
1 tsp salt

Preheat oven to 350F. Line the bottom of a 9" springform pan with parchment paper. Melt chocolate and butter in a double boiler or microwave (in short intervals), stirring occasionally. Pour the chocolate mixture into the bowl of a stand mixer. Add the eggs and mix at low speed, scraping the bowl as needed, until the mixture is completely smooth, 2-5 min. Pour the water into a small saucepan, then add the sugar and salt. Cook over medium low heat until the sugar and salt dissolve 1-2 min, swirling the pan to aid in even cooking. With the mixer at low speed, stream the melted sugar mixture into the chocolate. When all the sugar is incorporated, turn the mixer up to the medium high speed and mix until the batter is smooth and shiny, ~3 min. Scrape the batter into the springform pan. Bake for 30-35 min, until the edges look set but the center still looks shiny. Let cool before serving.
