Add the shrimp and saute about 30 s, until pink and curled. Remove shrimp and place on a plate with the cubed tofu. Set aside. Heat the remaining oil in the skillet and bring back to medium high heat. Add the curry paste and mash together with the oil until both are combined. Stir while cooking for another 2 min and then slowly whisk in the coconut milk and broth. Add the fish sauce, brown sugar, salt, basil, lime juice, lemograss, and chilies, and simmer for 10 min. Chop the cooked shrimp and add both that and the tofu to the skillet and heat through. Add cooked rice to individal bowls and top with soup and sprinkle with chopped cilantro. Don't forget to discard the lemongrass and chilies.
