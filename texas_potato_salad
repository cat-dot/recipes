Texas Potato Salad
  --Cook's Country

1/2 c red wine vinegar
1 1/2 tbsp sugar
salt and pepper
1 tsp yellow mustard seeds
1/2 small red onion, sliced thin
2 jalapeño chiles (1 sliced into thin rings; 1 stemmed, seeded, and minced)
3 lb Yukon Gold potatoes, peeled and cut into 3/4" pieces
6 tbsp mayonnaise
6 tbsp yellow mustard
1/4 tsp cayenne pepper
2 large hard-cooked eggs, cut into 1/4" pieces
1 celery rib, minced

Combine vinegar, sugar, 1 1/2 tsp salt, and mustard seeds in bowl and microwave until steaming, ~2 min. Whisk until sugar and salt are dissolved. Add onion and jalapeños and set aside until cool, 15-20 min. Strain onion and jalapeños through fine-mesh strainer set over bowl. Reserve pickled vegetables and vinegar mixture separately. Meanwhile, combine potatoes, 8 c water, and 1 tbsp salt in Dutch oven and bring to boil over high heat. Reduce heat to medium and simmer until potatoes are just tender, 10-15 min. Drain potatoes thoroughly, then transfer to large bowl. Drizzle 2 tbsp reserved vinegar mixture over hot potatoes and toss gently until evenly coated. (Reserve remaining vinegar mixture for another use.) Refrigerate until cool, ~30 min, stirring once halfway through chilling. Whisk mayonnaise, mustard, 1/2 tsp pepper, and cayenne together in bowl until combined. Add mayonnaise mixture, reserved pickled vegetables, eggs, and celery to potatoes and stir gently to combine. Season with salt and pepper to taste. Cover and refrigerate to let flavors blend, ~30 min. Serve. (Salad can be refrigerated for up to 2 days.)
