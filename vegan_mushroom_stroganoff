Vegan Mushroom Stroganoff
  --Terri Edwards

Stroganoff:
1 lb whole grain pasta, fettuccine or penne work well
1/4 c veggie broth or water
1 c onion, diced
4 cloves garlic, minced
1 lb mushrooms of choice, Portobello, button, or others
1 tsp rosemary
1 tsp thyme
salt & pepper to taste
1/2 c dry white wine
2 c Tofu Sour Cream, recipe below
1 Tbsp fresh chopped parsley or flakes

Begin by putting pasta on to cook according to package directions. While this is cooking start the mushroom stroganoff. In a large skillet, saute diced onion in 3 Tbsp of veggie broth or water ~5 min or until tender. Add more veggie broth, 1 tbsp at a time, if needed to keep from sticking. Add minced garlic, and cook another minute, adding more veggie broth if needed. Stir in mushrooms, thyme, rosemary, salt/pepper, and dry white wine. Cook on medium-low heat for ~15 min. While this is cooking, make tofu sour cream in a blender. Drain cooked pasta and set to the side. Add tofu sour cream to stroganoff mixture, along with cooked pasta. Stir well. Remove from heat. Garnish with parsley and serve warm. 

Tofu Sour Cream:
1 package tofu, firm silken
2 tbsp lemon juice
1 tbsp vinegar (red wine or apple cider work well)
1 clove garlic, (~1 tsp)
1/4 tsp salt, or to taste

Open tofu container and drain and press the water out. Blend all ingredients in a blender until creamy, scraping down sides of the blender as needed. Serve on baked potatoes, tacos, or enchiladas. Recipe makes approximately one pint of sour cream. 2 c will be used in this stroganoff recipe. Sour cream keeps in the refrigerator for ~10 days.
