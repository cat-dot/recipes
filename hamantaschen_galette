Hamantaschen Galette

Crust:
1 1/2 cap flour + more for rolling dough
1/2 tsp sugar
1/4 tsp salt
8 tbsp unsalted butter, chilled and cubed
6 tbsp ice water

In a food processor, combine the flour, sugar, salt, and butter. Pulse until butter pieces resemble coarse bread crumbs (pea sized). Add the ice water and continue to pulse until a dough just begins to come together. Transfer the dough to a lightly floured surface and shape into a disk. Wrap in plastic and refrigerate for 1 hr. Preheat oven to 350F and line baking sheet with parchment paper. On a lightly floured work surface, roll out dough into a cirlce, 1/8" thick (15" diameter). Tramsfer dough to baking sheet. 

Filling:
3/4 c almond meal
1/3 c sugar
1 tbsp unsalted butter, melted and cooled
1/2 tsp finely grated lemon zest
1/2 tsp vanilla
1/4 tsp almond extract
1/4 tsp salt
1 egg, lightly beaten
1/2 c apricot preserves, divided
5 (1 lb) apricots, peeled, halved, and pitted
1/2 tsp poppy seeds

In a medium bowl, mix together the almond meal, sugar, butter, zest, vanilla, almond extract, salt, and egg until smooth. Spread the filling evenly in the center of the circle, avoiding the outer 2". Spoon 2/3 of the preserves over the filling, using a spoon to lightly swirl the two together. Arrange the apricot halves into a circle over the filling. In a microwave, heat the remaining preserves until syrupy, ~30 s. Brush the apricots with the heated preserves, then sprinkle the top with poppy seeds. Fold the outer edges of the dough over the filling with 3 folds to form a large triangle, pinching the edges to seal. Bake, rotating once, until golden brown, 40-45 min. Let cool completely, then serve with whipped cream.

Note: can do standard galette shape too
