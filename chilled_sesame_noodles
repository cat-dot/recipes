Chilled Sesame Noodles
  --Lucas Sin

1  tbsp neutral-flavored oil
12  oz thin flour “yangchun noodles”, Chinese egg noodles, or other thin egg noodle
1/2  c Chinese sesame paste
1  block furu (fermented tofu), from 13 oz jar 
4 1/2  tbsp toasted sesame oil
1/4  c shoyu
3  tbsp sugar
2 1/2  tbsp Chinese black vinegar
1/2  tbsp dark soy sauce
1/2  tbsp Sichuan peppercorn oil
1/2  tbsp salt
1  tbsp mayonnaise, preferably Kewpie
1/4  c water (about)
sliced scallions, for serving
chile oil, for serving
toasted sesame seeds, coarsely ground using a mortar and pestle, for serving

In a small skillet, heat the oil just until it begins to shimmer. Transfer to a medium bowl and let cool. Cook the noodles according to the package directions. Drain and toss with the oil in the medium bowl or on a small rimmed baking sheet. Cover and refrigerate until cold. In a small bowl, whisk the sesame paste and furu until smooth. Add the sesame oil, shoyu, sugar, black vinegar, dark soy sauce, Sichuan peppercorn oil, and salt and whisk until smooth. Whisk in the mayonnaise and then whisk in enough of the water until a thin creamy, silky sauce forms. Divide the noodles among bowls; drizzle the sesame sauce on top. Garnish with the scallions, chile oil, and sesame seeds.
