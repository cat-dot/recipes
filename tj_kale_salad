Better than TJs Kale Salad
  --Dorothy Reinhold
  
Dressing:
3 tbsp Meyer lemon juice
4 tbsp evoo 
1 garlic clove, finely minced or crushed
3/4 tsp dried Italian herb blend
1/4 tsp kosher salt

Add all dressing ingredients to a large salad bowl and whisk until combined.

4 c finely chopped (chiffonade) Tuscan kale, ribs removed (~4 oz of kale)
15 oz can chickpeas, rinsed and drained
2/3 c dried cranberries (such as Craisins) soaked in boiling water to hydrate
1 c edamame beans, cooked and cooled
mint
basil
optional: carrot shreds (for color)
garnish: cherry tomatoes

Into the bowl with the dressing throw the kale, chickpeas, cranberries and edamame. Mince a handful of mint and a handful of basil leaves and toss them in, along with some carrot shreds, if available. Toss salad well to combine, and garnish with cherry tomatoes. Serves 6 as a side salad, or 2-3 as a main dish for kooky kale-lovers.
