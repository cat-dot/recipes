Macanese Almond & Strawberry Shortbread Serradura
  --Macao Tourism

1 c strawberries, sliced
1/2 c sugar, divided
1 c ap flour
3/4 c raw almond flour, toasted
1/2 c (1 stick) unsalted butter, softened
1/4 c light brown sugar
1/2 tsp kosher salt
1 tsp vanilla
1/4 c sweetened condensed milk
1 c heavy cream

Place the strawberries in a medium bowl with 1/4 c sugar and set aside. In a small bowl, combine the ap and almond flours; set aside. Add the butter, brown sugar, and remaining 1/4 c sugar to the bowl of a stand mixer. Mix on medium speed until light and fluffy, ~4 min. Add the flour mixture 1/2 c at a time, mixing thoroughly after each addition. Add the salt and vanilla, and mix for 30 s to combine. Turn the dough out onto a cool surface and divide into quarters. Roll each section into a log measuring ~1" thick and 6" long. Wrap in plastic and refrigerate until firm, ~1 hr. Preheat oven to 350. Slice the logs into rounds ~1/3" thick and place on ungreased large baking sheet ~2" apart. Bake for 10-12 min, until the edges appear golden. Place the baking sheets on cooling racks and let cool for 10 min. Combine the condensed milk and cream. Using a stand mixer fitted with the whisk attachment, whip until stiff peaks form. To finish, crush the cookies and layer the crumbs, strawberries, and whipped cream in one large bowl or in individual glasses until full and serve.
