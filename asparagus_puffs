Asparagus Puffs
  --Cook's Country
  
1 c ricotta cheese
1 c grated parmesan cheese
12 oz asparagus, trimmed, blanched, dried, and chopped fine
1/4 c minced fresh chives
2 tbsp lemon juice
Salt and pepper
1 box frozen puff pastry (1 lb), thawed in refrigerator overnight
Flour for dusting work surface
1 large egg, lightly beaten

Adjust oven rack to middle position and heat oven to 375F. Combine ricotta, 3/4 c parmesan, asparagus, chives, lemon juice, and salt and pepper to taste in bowl. Unfold both pieces puff pastry on lightly floured surface and roll out to flatten bumps or creases. Using 2 1/2" round cookie cutter, cut out 24 rounds. Brush rounds with egg. Place 1 tbsp cheese mixture slightly off center on each round. Fold round over cheese and crimp edges with fork. Place on parchment-lined baking sheet. Brush tops with egg and sprinkle with remaining parmesan. Bake until puffed and golden brown, ~20 min. Cool slightly and serve warm.

Notes: The puffs can be made ahead. Skip the step of brushing the tops with egg and sprinkling with cheese. Wrap the baking sheet tightly in plastic and freeze for up to 1 month (once completely frozen, the puffs can be transferred to a storage bag). When ready to bake, let the puffs sit at room temperature for 20 min, then brush with egg, sprinkle with cheese, and bake as directed.
