Chocolate Sandwich Cookie (Oreos)

Cookies:
2 1/2 c ap flour
1/2 c unsweetened cocoa powder
1 stick + 5 tbsp unsalted butter, softened
2/3 c granulated sugar
3/4 tsp fine sea salt
1 large egg white
1 tsp vanilla

Preheat oven to 350F and line 2 baking sheets with parchment paper. In a medium bowl, whisk together the flour and cocoa powder until incorporated. In the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with the paddle attachment, cream the butter with the sugar and salt until light and fluff. Add the egg white to the bowl and mix until smooth, then add the vanilla and continue mixing. Add the flour mixture and mix until a dough holds together. Transfer to a clean work surface and knead until smooth. Divide the douch in half and form each portion into a disk. Working with 1 disk at a time, roll each one between 2 sheets of parchment paper to a thickness of 1/8". Transfer both the freezer and freeze for 1 hr. Working with 1 sheet at a time, peel back the parchmnet and using a 2" round or fluted cutter, cut out 24 cookies from each sheet and place on the prepared baking sheets. Bake the cookies, rotating the trays top to bottom and fron to back, until firm to the touch, 12-14 min. Let cool completely.

Filling:
6 tbsp unsalted butter, softened
1 1/4 c confectioners' sugar
2 tsp vanilla
1/4 tsp fine sea salt

In the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with the paddle attachment, beat all of the filling ingredients together until light and fluffy, 3-4 min. Spread 1/2 tbsp of the filling on 1 cookie and sandwich with another. Repeat until you have 2 dozen sandwich cookies. Chill the cookies for 1 hr until the filling is firm, 30 min, then serve.
