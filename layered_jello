Layered Jello   -gf

6x3oz jello
4 envelopes unflavored gelatin (knox) or 8 tsp
14 oz can sweetened condensed milk
boiling water

First layer: mix 1 package of jello with 1 tsp knox and 1 c boiling water. Cool and pour into 9x13" pan; refrigerate until set. Ensure that the landing spot is level. It takes ~30 min to set up in the fridge before you can move onto the next layer. While waiting, make the next layer and let cool on the couter top.
Second layer: 1 envelope (2 tsp) knox with 1/2 c hot water until dissolved. Add 1/2 c condensed milk and an additional 1/2 c hot water. Once cooled, pour 3/4 c over the set jello and refrigerate until firm, 30 min. As soon as you put this back in the fridge, make the next layer so that it can cool on the couter.
Repeat first and second layer directions ending with a colored jello. Once finished, covered with plastic wrap and refrigerate overnight. Slice into rectangles or squares and serve.

Notes: if a layer sets up too much while waiting, set the bowl with the jello into another bowl of hot water and it hopefully will loosen up.
