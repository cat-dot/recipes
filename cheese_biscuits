North Carolina Cheese Biscuits
  --Cook's Country

8 oz yellow sharp cheddar cheese, shredded (2 cups)
3 1/2 c (17 1/2 oz) ap flour, divided
1 tbsp sugar
1 tbsp baking powder
1/2 tsp baking soda
1 tsp salt
4 tbsp unsalted butter, cut into 1/4" pieces and chilled + 2 tbsp melted
1 1/2 c buttermilk

Adjust oven rack to middle position and heat oven to 500F. Grease light-colored 9" round cake pan. Working with 1/3 c cheese, use your hands to squeeze cheese tightly into firm ball. Repeat with remaining cheese to form 5 more balls; set cheese balls aside. Pulse 2 1/2 c flour, sugar, baking powder, baking soda, and salt in food processor until combined, ~6 pulses. Add chilled butter and pulse until mixture resembles pebbly, coarse cornmeal, 8-10 pulses. Transfer mixture to large bowl. Stir in buttermilk until just combined. (Dough will be very wet and slightly lumpy.) Spread remaining 1 c flour in rimmed baking sheet. Using greased 1/2 c dry measuring cup, transfer 6 portions of dough to prepared sheet. Dust top of each portion with flour from sheet. Using your well-floured hands, gently flatten 1 portion of dough into 3 1/2" circle and coat with flour. Pick up dough and place 1 cheese ball in center. Gently pull edges of dough over cheese to enclose and pinch together to seal. Shake off excess flour and transfer to prepared pan. Repeat with remaining dough and cheese, placing 5 biscuits around edge of pan and one in center. (Biscuits will be soft and will spread slightly as they sit.) Brush biscuit tops with melted butter. Bake for 5 min, then reduce oven temperature to 450F. Continue to bake until biscuits are deep golden brown, 15-20 min longer. Let biscuits cool in pan for 2 min, then invert onto plate. Break biscuits apart and turn right side up. Let cool for 5 min; serve warm.
