Buttermilk-Brined Fried Chicken

1 qt buttermilk
2 tbsp salt
4 cloves garlic, smashed
3 sprigs rosemary, bruised
3 sprigs of sage, bruised
3 sprigs thyme, bruised
2 bay leaves
1 tbsp hot sauce, preferably Crystal brand 
zest and juice from 1 lemon
One 3 ½ to 4 lb whole chicken, cut into 8 pieces
Canola oil, for frying
2 c ap flour
½ tsp cayenne pepper
Fleur de sel, to garnish

Combine the buttermilk, salt, garlic, rosemary, sage, thyme, bay leaves, hot sauce and lemon zest and juice. Add the chicken to the buttermilk brine and cover; refrigerate for at least 4 hours or overnight. Remove the chicken from the brine and transfer to a wire rack placed over a parchment-lined sheet tray. Allow the chicken to sit at room temperature for 2 hrs to allow the salt to redistribute. Pour enough oil in a 6-quart Dutch oven until it reaches a depth of 2". Heat the oil until a deep-fry thermometer reads 375°. While the oil is heating, combine the flour and cayenne together in a large bowl. Dredge the chicken in the flour mixture; making sure that every piece is coated evenly with flour. Fry the chicken in two batches, cooking the larger pieces first, until golden brown and crisp, about 10-12 min  or until an instant-read thermometer inserted into the thickest part of the thigh reads 155°. Transfer chicken to a wire rack placed over a paper towel-lined sheet tray; season with fleur de sel and serve with honey or hot sauce. 

Note: If you achieve a golden brown exterior before reaching the correct internal temperature, remove the pieces from the dutch oven and finish cooking them on a roasting rack in the oven at 400°.
Also for better results, brine overnight and let sit in dredge for 1 hr
