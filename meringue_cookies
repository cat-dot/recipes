Hazelnut Meringue Cookies with Manischewitz and Rubarb Conserva

Cookies:
7 egg whites
2 1/2 c granulated sugar
1 lb whole hazelnuts, toasted and partially skinned
2 tsp vanilla
1/2 tsp ground cinnamon

Preheat oven to 300F and line 2 baking sheets with parchment paper. In a stand mixer bowl fitted with the whisk attachment, whip the egg whites until foamy. Gradually stream in the sugar and continue whisking until stiff, glossy peaks form. Remove the bowl from the mixer and, using a rubber spatula, fold in the hazelnuts, vanilla, and cinnamon. Using a 1/3 c scoop, drop 12 dollops of batter onto each baking sheet, 1" apart. Bake for 39 min, then reduce the heat to 200F and continue to bake for another 60 min. Turn off the oven and allow the cookies to completely cool in the oven, preferably overnight.

Conserva:
3/4 c red wine
3/4 c manischewitz wine
3/4 c sugar
1/2 tbsp coriander seeds, toasted
1 tsp anise seeds, toasted
1 cinnamon stick
1 lemon, zested with a peeler
1/2 lb (2 medium stalks) rhubarb, small dice
1 tbsp lemon juice
1/2 tsp salt

In a mediium saucepan, combine the red and manishewitz wines, sugar, coriander and anise seeds, cinnamon stick, and lemon zest. Bring to a simmer over medium heat and cook until slightly reduced so that the syrup coats the bak of a spoon, 15-20 min. Strain the syrup and return to the pot, discarding the solids. Return the syrup to a simmer and add the rhubarb. Cook until just tender, 1-2 min, then remove from heat and stir in the lemon juice and salt. Let cool completely, then refrigerate for at least 1 hr, preferably overnight.
