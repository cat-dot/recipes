Chocolate Frosting gf,df
  --Connie Veilleux
  
2 c powdered sugar
6 tbsp unsweetened cocoa powder
1/4 c non-dairy spread (earth balance, etc. - I used coconut oil) melted
1/4 c non-dairy milk (almond, coconut, etc)
1/2 tsp vanilla

Add all ingredients to a mixing bowl. Using a whisk, stir until well mixed and frosting has a smooth, creamy consistency. If the frosting seems thin, let it sit in bowl for a few minutes before using. It will set up slightly after a few minutes, making it the perfect consistency for spreading. If frosting is still too thin, add 1 tbsp powder sugar at a time. If too thick, add "milk" a tsp at a time. Makes ~2 c.
