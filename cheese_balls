Cheese Balls  - gf
  --Cook's Country

2 c shredded extra-sharp cheddar cheese
8 oz cream cheese, softened
2 tbsp mayonnaise
1 tbsp Worcestershire sauce
1 garlic clove, minced
¼ tsp cayenne pepper
½ c sliced almonds, toasted 

Process cheddar, cream cheese, mayonnaise, Worcestershire, garlic, and cayenne in food processor until smooth. Transfer cheese mixture to center of large sheet of plastic wrap and tightly wrap, shaping cheese into rough ball. Refrigerate until firm, ~3 hr. (Cheese ball can be refrigerated for 2 days.)  Once cheese ball is firm, reshape as necessary to form smooth ball. Unwrap and roll in almonds to coat. Let sit at room temperature for 15 min. Serve.


Notes: To shape the cheese ball, dump the cheese mixture from the food processor into the center of a large sheet of plastic wrap. Holding the four corners of the plastic in one hand, twist the cheese with your other hand to seal the plastic and shape the cheese into a rough ball. Don't worry if the cheese is soft. It will firm up in the refrigerator.
