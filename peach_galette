Homestead's Peach Galette

Dough:
1 c butter, diced in 1/2" cubes and chilled
1/2 c creme fraiche
1 tsp salt
1 2/3 c ap flour
2/3 c whole wheat flour

Sift together the flours and salt onto a large flat surface. Scatter the chilled butter cubes over the flour mixture, and form into a rough rectangle. Start rolling the butter into the flour with a rolling pin, gathering up the edges while you roll to maintain a rectangular shape. Once the butter looks like long thin flakes in the flour, make a well in the middle and pour in the creme fraiche. Fold some of the flour and butter over the creme fraiche and begin rolling again. When the dough is rolled out to 1/2", fold it over on itself in thirds and roll out again. Repeat this process until the dough is mostly smooth and cohesive, ~3 times. Wrap tightly in plastic and chill at least 2hrs or overnight.

Egg Wash:
1 egg
2 egg yolks

Whisk together vigorously. Strain, set aside.

Filling:
3-4 fresh peaches
1/4 c granuated sugar
juice of 1/2 lemon

Peel the skin off the peaches and slice into thin wedges. Toss very gently with the sugar and lemon. Set aside.

Assembly
Preheat oven to 375F. Cut dough into 6 equal pieces. Roll them out one by one on a heavily floured surface, rotating after every couple strokes to help prevent sticking. When the dough is done it should be very thing, ~ 1/16" thick. Make a small circle of peach slices in the middle, leaving ~ 1" perimeter. Fold the edges of the dough in towards the middle, leaving a circle of filling exposed. Brush the edges with egg wash, sprinkle with sugar and chill for 10 min. Bake for 20-30 min until crust is browned and crisp.
