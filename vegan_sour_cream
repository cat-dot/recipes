Vegan Sour Cream

#1 by Terri Edwards
2 tbsp lemon juice
1 tbsp red wine vinegar
1 clove garlic (or more)
1/4 tsp salt

Open tofu package and drain any water. If using shelf-stable tofu, there won't be much water. For the refrigerated tofu, you'll need to drain and then press all water out. Place all ingredients in a blender or food processor and blend until smooth. Keeps in air tight container in the refrigerator for up to 10 days.

1 c (150g) raw cashews
1/3 c (80ml) Water
1 tbsp lemon juice (freshly squeezed)
1 tbsp apple cider vinegar
1 tbsp nutritional yeast
1/2 tsp sea salt

Add all ingredients to the blender and blend until very smooth. Keep up to a week in the refrigerator.

Notes: for an easier time blending, soak cashews in boiling water for 15 min
