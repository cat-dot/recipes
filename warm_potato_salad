Warm German Potato Salad

1 lb fingerling potatoes
4 oz green beans, trimmed and halved crosswise
Â½ c olive oil
2 shallots, thinly sliced into rings
1 garlic clove, minced
2 tbsp red wine vinegar
1 tbsp whole-grain Dijon mustard
1 tbsp minced parsley
Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper, to taste

In a large pot, cover the potatoes with salted water, then bring to a boil over high heat. Cook the potatoes until tender, 10-12 min, then transfer to a bowl. Once the potatoes are cool enough to handle, slice each one in half lengthwise and set aside. Prepare a medium bowl of ice water. Add the green beans to the pot and cook until just tender, while retaining a slight bite, 3-4 min. Transfer to the ice bath until cool, then drain and set aside. In a large skillet, heat the olive oil over medium-high heat. Add the shallots and cook until golden brown, 2-3 min. Add the reserved potatoes and the garlic, and cook until the potatoes are golden brown, 4 min. Stir in the green beans, vinegar, Dijon and parsley, and cook until warmed through, another 2 min. Season with salt and pepper, and serve.
