  --Bon Appetit

1 1/2 c ap flounr
1 1/4 tsp baking soda
3/4 tsp kosher salt
1 c packed dark brown sugar
1/3 c mascarpone, plain whole milk greek yogurt, or sour cream
1/3 c (1/2 stick) unsalted butter
2 large eggs
4 large very ripe banans, mashed (~1 1/2 c)
1/2 c chopped bittersweet or semisweet chocolate (optional
1/2 c chopped walnuts (optional)

Preheat oven to 350F. Lightly coat 8 1/2 x 4 1/2" loaf pan with nonstick spray and line with parchment paper sling. Whisk flour, baking soda, and salt in medium bowl. Using an electric mixer on medium high speed, beat sugar, mascarpone, and butter until light and fluffy, ~4 min. Add eggs 1 at a time, beating to blend after each addition and scraping down sides and bottom of bowl as needed. Reduce speed to low, add flour mixture, and mix until just combined. Add bananas and mix until just combined. Fold in chocolate and/or walnuts if using. Scrape batter into prepared pan; smooth top. Bake until a tester inserted into the center comes out clean, 60-65 min. Transfer pan to a wire rack and let cool 1 hr in pan. Turn out bread and let cool completely before slicing.


Notes: substitutions that worked: 1/2 c coconut sugar for the 1 c brown; 4 tbsp coconut oil for the butter
sprinkle top with turbinado sugar (or any really) to push it over the top
