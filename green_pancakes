Green Pancakes

2 c flour
3 tbsp sugar
1 tsp kosher salt
2 tbsp baking powder
2 large eggs, separated into whites and yolks
2 cu whole milk
7 oz fresh spinach
1/2 c lightly packed fresh mint leaves with stems (1/2 oz; use tender leaves and stems; avoid using dark, tough stems)
4 tbsp (1/2 stick) unsalted butter, melted
Olive oil
1/2 c fresh goat cheese, for serving
1/2 c strawberry preserves, for serving
1/2 c roasted unsalted pumpkin seeds, for serving

Stir together the flour, sugar, salt and baking powder in a bowl. Use a whisk or handheld electric mixer to beat the egg whites in a separate, clean bowl, until they form stiff peaks.  Combine the egg yolks, milk, spinach and mint in a blender and process until fully incorporated, then pour that mixture and the melted butter into the flour mixture and stir well. Gently fold in the egg whites (all at once). Preheat oven to 200F. Coat a medium nonstick skillet lightly with the oil and heat over medium-high heat. Scoop up 1/2 cup of the batter with a measuring c or ladle and pour into the center of the skillet. Cook until browned in spots on the bottom side and bubbles have formed around the edges, 2-3 min. Use a large spatula to flip the pancake to cook the second side, adding more oil to the pan as needed for the second side to crisp up. Transfer to a baking sheet or ovenproof platter and place in the warm oven. Repeat to use all the batter.

Serve right away, topped with goat cheese (savory) and/or with strawberry preserves (sweet). Top with pumpkin seeds.
