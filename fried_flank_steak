Flank Steak
  --Grandma Tosh
  
Marinade:
1 flank steak
2 tbsp sugar
1/4 c shoyu
ginger
garlic

Marinate 1/2 hr. 

Assembly:
4 eggs
1 tbsp sesame seeds
flour
Roll in flour, eggs & 2 sesame seeds. Fry.


Notes: this is pretty much the recipe I was given by my grandmother - with ever so slightly more info :)
Now, typically asked butcher to run the steak through tenderizer both ways, then cut the steak into manageable chunks before putting in the marinade (also used to marinate for longer than 1/2 hr). It's a shallow fry (oil up to half-ish), flip after first side is GBD. Once done, put on a rack set in a baking sheet to drain. Once cooled enough to handle, cut chunks into strips and serve.
