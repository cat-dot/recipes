Chocolate Chip Cookies

1 1/2 c ap flour
1 tsp baking powder
1/2 tsp kosher salt
1/4 tsp baking soda
2 large eggs
1 tsp vanilla 
10 tbsp unsalted butter, room temperature
3/4 c granulated sugar
3/4 c (packed) light brown sugar
8 oz chopped high-quality semisweet chocolate or chocolate chips (about 1 1/2 c)

Preheat oven to 375°F. Whisk flour, baking powder, salt, and baking soda in a medium bowl. Lightly beat eggs and vanilla in a small bowl. Using an electric mixer on medium speed, beat butter, granulated sugar, and brown sugar in a large bowl until light and fluffy, 3–4 min. Add egg mixture and beat, occasionally scraping down sides of bowl, until mixture is pale and fluffy, 3–4 min. Reduce mixer speed to low and gradually add dry ingredients, beating until just incorporated. Fold in chocolate with a spatula. Spoon dough out onto baking sheets (12 each, 1" apart). Chill dough 15 min before transferring to oven to prevent dough from spreading too much as it bakes. Bake cookies, rotating sheets halfway through, until just golden brown around the edges, 10–12 min. 

Notes: Dough can be made 3 months ahead. Wrap tightly and freeze.
