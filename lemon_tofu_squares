 - Martha Stewart
 
Crust:
1/2 c coconut oil, melted + more for brushing
1/4 c cane sugar
1 tsp vanilla
1 1/2 c whole wheat pastry flour
1/4 tsp coarse salt

Preheat oven to 350F. Brush 8" square baking dish with oil, then line with parchment, leaving an overhang, and brush parchment with oil. Stir together oil, sugar, vanilla, and salt. Add flour and stir until just combined. Press dough into prepared dish and bake until pale golden brown, ~20 min.

Filling:
1/2 c silken tofu
3/4 c cane sugar
1 tbsp grated lemon zest
1/4 c lemon juice
1/4 tsp baking powder
2 tbsp whole wheat pastry flour
confectioners' sugar for dusting

Process tofu, sugar, lemon zest and juice, baking powder, and flour in a food processor until smooth. Pour onto baked crust and bake until set, 25-30 min. Let cool completely, then dust with confectioners' sugar and cut into squares.


Notes: can sub agave syrup for sugar, reducing to 1/2 c. Also can add shredded coconut to crust.
