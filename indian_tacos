Indian Flank Steak Tacos

Masala:
3 tbsp canola oil
1 large red onion, diced
1/2 c packed curry leaves
6 garlic cloves, roughly chopped
1 serrano chile, minced
3" piece ginger, peeled and roughly chopped
1/4 c shoyu
1/4 c white distilled vinegar
2 tbsp freshly ground black pepper
1 tbsp tamarind pulp
1 tsp sugar
1 tsp kosher salt

In a 12" skillet, heat the oil over medium high heat. Add the onions and cook until translucent and lightly golden, 3-4 min. Add the curry leaves, garlic, serrano, and ginger, and cook until fragrant, 2 min. Remove from the heat and transfer to a blender with the remaining masala ingredients. Blend until smooth, then let cool completely.

Tacos:
1 1/2 lb flank steak
1/2 red onion + more for serving, thinly sliced
2 tbsp freshly squeezed lime juice
grilled naan for serving
lime wedges for serving
cilantro leaves for serving

In a large bowl, toss the flank steak with the masala to coat. Refrigerate for at least 1 hr. Meanwhile, in a small bowl, toss the sliced red onion with lime juice and set aside. Light a grill or heat a cast iron grill pan over high heat. Grill the steak, flipping once, until caramelized and medium rare, 7-8 min. Let rest for 5 min, then thinly slice against the grain on a bias. Serve the steak with pieces of grilled naan, sliced red onion and lime wedges, garnishing with cilantro.
