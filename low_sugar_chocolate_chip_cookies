  --America's Test Kitchen

1 3/4 c (8 3/4 oz) ap flour
1 tsp baking powder
3/4 tsp baking soda
1/2 tsp salt
10 tbsp unsalted butter
2/3 c + 1/2 c (6 2/3 oz) sucanat
1 large egg + 1 yolk
1 tbsp vanilla
5 oz bittersweet chocolate, chopped

Combine flour, baking powder, baking soda,  and salt in medium bowl. Using stand mixer fitted with paddle, beat butter and sucanat together on medium high until pale and fluffy, ~3 min. Add egg + yolk and vanilla and mix until combined, ~1 min. Reduce speed to low, add flour mixture, and mix until combined, ~1 min, scraping down bowl as needed. Add chocolate and mix until combined, ~30 d. Give dough final stir by hand. Cover bowl with plastic wrap and rest at room temp for 30 min. Adjust oven rack to middle position and heat oven to 350F. Line 2 baking sheets with parchment. Working with scant 3 tbsp of dough at a time, roll into balls and space 2" apart on prepared sheets. Bake cookies, 1 sheet at a time, until light golden brown and edges have begun to set but centers are still soft, 12-15 min, rotating sheet halfway through. Let cookis cool completely on sheet. Serve.
