Mushroom Carbonara
  --Molly Baz

kosher salt
5 large yolks
1 large egg
4 oz finely grated parmesan + more for serving
1 1/2 tsp freshly ground black pepper + more to taste
1 1/2 lb crimini or button mushrooms, stemmed, torn into quarters (or half if small)
1/4 c evoo
1 lb orecchiette (or any small pasta shape)
2 medium shallots, peeled, finely choppe
6 garlic cloves, thinly sliced
1 c parsley leaves with tender stems (~1/2 bunch) coarsely chopped

Fill a large pot with water and season well with a few big pinches of salt. Bring to a boil. Meanwhile, whisk yolks, egg, parmesan, and pepper in a medium bowl; set aside. Heat a large dutch oven over medium-high 3 min. You want to get the pan very hot since adding the mushrooms is going to lower the temperature of the surface of the pan. Add mushrooms and oil and toss once to coat in oil. Cook, tossing once every 4–5 min (but mostly undisturbed), until mushrooms are mostly golden brown, 13–16 min. This will take some time and they will let out a lot of moisture before they start to brown, so stick with it! Once mushrooms have been cooking for ~10 min, drop pasta into boiling water and set a timer 2 min shy of al dente according to package directions. Reduce heat to medium-low for mushrooms and add shallots, garlic, and 1½ tsp. salt. Cook, stirring often, until aromatics are softened but not browned, 30–60 s. Reserve 2 c pasta water, then drain pasta. Add pasta + 1 c pasta liquid to mushroom mixture. Cook over medium low heat, stirring often to finish cooking the pasta and absorbe liquid, ~2 min. Remove pot from heat completely and let cool 3 min. Add 1/2 c pasta liquid to reserve egg mixture while whisking to temper. Gradually add egg mixture to pot, stirring vigorously, and adding more pasta liquid as needed to loosen things up, until a very creamy, luscious sauce coats all noodles. Add parsley and stir to combine. Taste and adjust seasoning as needed. Serve with parmesan and more fresh ground black pepper.
