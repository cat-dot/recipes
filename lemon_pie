Lemon Pie
  --Joanna Gaines

vegetable oil spray
1 1/2 c crushed graham crackers (~27 squares)
1/3 c sugar
6 tbsp salted butter, melted
3 c sweetened condensed milk
3 egg yolks
2/3 c fresh lemon juice (3-4 lemons)
pinch of salt

Preheat oven to 350F. Lightly spray a 9" pie tin with vegetable oil. In a large bowl, combine the crushed graham crackers and 1/3 c of sugar and stir to blend. Stir in the butter until well blended. Press the cracker mixture onto the bottom and up the sides of the prepared pie plate. Bake until firm, ~8 min. In a stand mixer fitted with the paddle attachment, beat the condensed milk, yolks, lemon juice, and salt on medium speed for 4 min. Pour the mixture into the baked crust. Return to the oven and bake until the center is set when the pan is gently nudged, ~10 min. Cool the pie on a rack for 30 min. Place in the refrigerator until set, at least 1 hr and up to 3 days.

Whipped topping:
1 c heavy cream
2 tbsp sugar
1 tsp vanilla

Just before serving, make the topping. In a medium bowl with an electric mixer, beat all the ingredients on high speed until fluffy and the cream holds a soft peak. Spread the cream on the cooled pie. 

Can garnish with fresh lemon slices, zest, mint sprigs.
