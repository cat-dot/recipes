Pancakes

2 c ap flour (can use alt flours)
2 tsp baking powder
1/4 tsp salt
1 tbsp sugar (optional)
2 eggs
1 1/2 - 2 c milk
2 tbsp melted and cooled butter (optional) or use neutral oil

Heat a griddle or large skillet over medium low heat. In a bowl, mix dry ingredients together. Beat eggs into 1 1/2c milk, then stir in 2 tbsp cooled melted butter, if using. Gently stir this mixture into dry ingredients, mixing only enough to moisten flour; don't worry about a few lumps. If batter seems thick, add a little more milk. Place tsp or 2 of butter or oil on cooking surface. When butter foam subsides or oil shimmers, ladle batter onto griddle =, making pancakes of any size. Adjust heat as necessary; usually first batch will require higher heat than subsequent. Flip after bubbles rise to surface and bottom browns, 2-4 min. Serve, or hold on an ovenproof plate in a 200F oven for up to 15 min.


Note: if using buttermilk, don't forget to add tsp of baking soda. Can augment with 2 heaping tbsp of sour cream which makes them fluffier. Can also add vanilla.
