Smoked Chilli Scalloped Sweet Potatoes

480ml double cream
1 heaping tbsp chipotle chilli puree
3 medium sweet potatoes, sliced thinly (1/3 cm thick)
salt and pepper


Preheat oven to 190C. Whisk the cream and chipotle puree until smooth.
In a 23cm square casserole dish, arrange the potatoes in an even layer, one-slice thick. Drizzle with 3 tbsp of the cream mixture and season with salt and pepper. Lather, rinse, repeat to form 10 layers. Cover and bake for 30m. Remove the cover and continue baking for 45-60m, or until the cream has been absorbed, the potatoes are cooked through, and the top is browned.
