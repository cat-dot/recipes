#Japanese Shakshuka
adapted from Emily Yuen

Tofu Labneh:
14 oz package extra firm tofu
1/4 c red miso

Wrap the tofu in cheesecloth and place between 2 plates. Set a light weight on top of the plates to weigh down the tofu and press out the water. Refrigerate overnight. The next day, unwrap the tofu and slather it with the miso. Let marinate in the refrigerator for at least 1 day, or up to 1 week. Scrape off the excess miso, crumble, and set aside.

Roasted Squash:
1/4 medium (10oz) kabocha, seeded and cut into 1/2" wedges
2 tbsp olive oil, divided
kosher salt to taste

Preheat oven to 450F. On a sheet pan, toss the squash with the oil and salt. Roast until golden brown and tender, 15-20 min. Remove the skin and cut into large chunks, then set aside.

Shakshuka:
2 tbsp olive oil
1 yellow onion, thinly sliced
8 garlic cloves, minced
1" piece ginger, peeled and finely grated
2 tbsp unsalted butter
2 tbsp ap flour
1/4 c Japanese curry powder
2 tbsp harissa paste
2 tsp ground cumin
4 c crushed tomatoes
kosher salt to taste
5 poached eggs, for serving
pomegranate arils for garnish
parsley leaves for garnish
toasted milk bread for serving

In a 4 quart dutch oven, heat the oil over medium heat. Add the onions and sweat until softened, 8-10 min. Add the garlic and ginger, and cook until fragrant. Add the butter and melt, then stir in the flour until incorporated and cook for 2 min. Add the curry, harissa, and cumin, stirring to incorporate. Add the tomatoes and bring to a simmer. Cook, stirring often, until thickened, 10-12 min. Season with salt. Stir in squash and cook until warmed through, 2 min. Remove from the heat and make 5 wells in the sauce. Add a poached egg to each well, then garnish with tofu labneh, pomegranate, and parsley. Serve with toasted milk bread.
