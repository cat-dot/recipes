Coconut Flour Bread
  --coconut mama

6 eggs, at room temperature
1/2 c coconut Oil, melted and cooled
1 tbsp raw honey (optional)
3/4 c coconut flour
2 tbsp arrowroot powder (optional, makes a lighter loaf)
1/2 tsp sea salt
1 tsp (grain free) baking powder

Preheat oven to 350F. Use a medium/large bowl, mix eggs, coconut oil and honey (if using). Mix until all the wet ingredients are combined. Add coconut flour, arrowroot powder, baking powder and salt to the wet mixture and mix until the batter is lump free. Allow the batter to sit for 5 min. Scoop batter into a greased bread pan (I used a medium bread pan, 7 3/8″ x 3 5/8″ x 2″). Bake bread until the top is golden brown and a toothpick inserted into the middle comes out clean, ~35-40 min.
