Company Potatoes

2 1/2 lbs russet potatoes, scrubbed and cut into 1/4" cubes
8 oz package cream cheese at room temp
1/2 c unsalted butter, melted + more for the pan
1 c sour cream
1/4 - 1/2 c whole milk
kosher salt and ground pepper to taste
2 1/2 c grated sharp cheddar cheese (~8oz)
chopped fresh parsley for garnish

Heat oven to 325F. Put potatoes in a large heavy bottomed pot and cover with cold water. Set on stove over high heat and bring to a boil, then reduce heat and allow potatoes to simmer until they have just started to soften, ~10 min. Drain and set aside. Combine cream cheese, butter, and sour cream in a large bowl and stir to combine. Add enough milk so that the mixture is creamy but not soupy. Season with salt and pepper to taste. Add potatoes to bowl and stir gently to combine. Generously grease a 9x13" baking dish. Top half the potatoes into the dish and spread to the edges, then scatter half the grated cheese over the top. Add the remaining potatoes and spread to the edges, then top with remaining cheese. Bake until casserole is bubbling at the edges and cheese has melted across the top, 30-35 min. Sprinkle with parsley before serving (optional)
