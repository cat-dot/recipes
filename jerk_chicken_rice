Jerk Chicken Rice
  --Sam the Cooking Guy

2 lb skin on bone in chicken thighs
2/3 c wet jerk seasoning, divided
1/2 tsp kosher salt
1/4 tsp freshly ground black pepper
1 tbsp avocado oil
1/2  yellow onion, diced
2 cloves garlic, finely chopped
1 c  white rice
15 oz can red kidney beans, drained
1 c chicken broth
1 can coconut milk
2 tablespoons Worcestershire
Couple sprigs of fresh thyme 

Preheat oven to 350F. Put chicken in a large bowl, add 1/3 cup jerk seasoning and toss well to coat. Heat any large oven proof pan on medium high, add oil and then chicken. Cook ~3 min or until beautifully golden brown, then flip, cook another couple of minutes – and remove to a plate. Leaving only a couple tbsp of grease in the pan, add the onion, stirring until softened then put in the garlic. Cook ~1 min then add the rice and stir well for a couple minutes to let it toast just a bit. Then add the chicken broth, coconut milk, beans and Worcestershire and remaining jerk wet rub - stirring really well to combine everything. Add chicken back in and a couple sprigs of fresh thyme, cover well with a lid or foil, and put in the oven for ~1 hr – or until the chicken is super tender and the rice prefect.


Notes: Recipe for wet jerk seasoning in repo. I used basmati rice and it was very wet - too much liquid.
