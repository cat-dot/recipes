Stir in cheese, poblano, scallions, pepper, remaining salt, and remaining chickpeas until combined. Spread 1 c chickpea mixture over half of each tortilla, leaving 1/" border at edge. Fold tortillas over filling and press firmly to seal. Heat 1 tbsp oil in 12" nonstick skillet over medium heat until shimmering. Place 2 quesadillas in skillet. Set large saucepan on top of quesadillas and cook until browned on both sides and cheese is melted, ~2 min per side. Transfer to cutting board and repeat with remaining oil and quesadillas. Cut into wedges and serve with avocado sauce.


Note: If avocados aren't ripe enough, may need to add more water (1-2 tbsp)
