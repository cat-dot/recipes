Turkey Jook

3 quarts turkey stock
1 1/2 c long grain white rice
1/2 c wild rice
2-4 c water, divided + more as needed
3/4 lb sunchokes, cut into 1/2" pieces (4 c cut)
3/4 lb brussels sprouts, outer leaves removed and quartered (3 c cut)
2 tbsp canola oil, divided
kosher salt to taste
4 medium carrots roughly chopped (2 c chopped)
3 celery ribs roughly chopped (2 c chopped)
1 garlic clove minced (~1 tbsp)
1" piece ginger minced (1 tbsp)

Preheat oven to 425F and arrange one rack in the middle and one in the lower third of the oven. Pour the turkey stock into a clean stockpot, along with the pulled meat and white and wild rice. Bring to a boil over medium high heat, then reduce the heat to low and cover with the lid ajar. Simmer, stirring occasionally so the bottom doesn't burn, until the white rice is broken down and the wild rice is cooked through, adding water as needed, ~1.5hrs. The mixture should be the consistency of a loose porridge. Can make ahead and store in in the fridge for 1 day. To reheat, add 2-3 c of water and bring to a simmer, stirring often until hot. While the rice is cooking, roast the vegetables. Line a rimmed baking sheet with parchment paper and add the sunchokes and brussels srpouts. Toss with 1 tbsp of the canola oil and season with salt. Line a separate sheet tray with parchment paper and add the carrots, celery, garlic, and ginger. Toss with the remaining 1 tbsp of canola oil and 1 tbsp of water and season with salt. Roast the brussels sprouts and sunchokes on the middle rack for 10 min, then lover the oven temp to 400F and add the carrots and celery to the bottom oven rack, roasting all the vegetables 10 min more.
