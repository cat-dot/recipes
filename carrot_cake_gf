Gluten Free Sugar Free Carrot Cake
  --Jessica Kellgren-Fozard

Cake:
340g finely shredded carrots
100g coconut flour
100g almond flour
20g unsweetened shredded dried coconut
100g artificial sweetener (sucralose) or 50g stevia
2 tsp baking powder
1 tsp salt
1 tsp cinnamon
8 egg whites
280 ml unsweetened soy milk (or other dairy free)
100g coconut margarine (or other dairy free)
2 tsp vanilla

Preheat oven to 160C/325F. Line 2x8" round cake pans with parchment paper and grease the sides. In one bowl combine the carrots, flours, shredded coconut, sweetener, baking powder, salt, and cinnamon. Whisk until well mixed. In a different bowl whisk the whites, milk, melted margarine, and vanilla. Add the wet to the dry; stir until a thick, sticky batter is created. Add extra milk if the batter is too thick to pour. Pour the batter into the prepared pans, using a spatula to evenly spread. If your oven is large enough then bake both cakes on the middle rack for an hour. With a smaller oven bake on separate racks for 30 min, then switch and bake for another 30 min. Take out of the oven once the cakes are lightly golden brown, springy when pressed, and a knife inserted into the center comes out clean. Let the cake cool in the pans for 15 min before moving to a rack. 

Frosting:
680g cream cheese
100g coconut margarine (or other dairy free)
70g artificial sweetener (sucralose) or 35g stevia
1/2 tsp cinnamon
4 tsp vanilla
2 tbsp unsweetened soy milk (or other dairy free)
unsweetened shredded dried coconut for decoration
pecans for decoration

Combine all frosting ingredients and mix with an electric mixer until fluffy and creamy. Spread an even layer of frosting ~ 1/2" thick across the top of one cake. Position the second layer on top then spread the remaining frosting across the top and on the sides of the cake. Press shredded coconut into the sides of the cake and use the pecans to decorate the top.
