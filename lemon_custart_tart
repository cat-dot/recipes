Lemon Custard Tart
  --Tane Tachyon

Preheat oven to 350F.

Crust:
1 c + 2 tbsp flour
1/4 c + 1 1/2 tsp powdered sugar
1/2 c (1 stick) + 1 tbsp butter

Dump all ingredients into a food processor and let it run until the contents change from a storm of flour whirling around to a soft ball of dough rolling around. Put the dough into a 9" pie tin and spread it around with your fingers. Keep bowl of food processor handy for uses with filling.

Filling:
1 c sugar
2 tbsp flour
1/2 tsp baking powder
3 eggs
1/2 c lemon juice
zest of 1 lemon
(optional) fruit: cranberries, blackberries, blueberries, diced stone fruit, etc.

Dump all ingredients into food processor and run until contents are well mixed and a little bubbly on the top. Pour into crust. If you are adding any additional fruit, you can either put some in crust before pouring in the filling or place them on top after. Use as much or as little as you like, as long as it doesn't cause the filling to overflow out the pie tin. Bake, checking at 20 min, then every 5 min or so after that until it's starting to get cracks on the top. Serve immediately. 


Notes: Can add fresh, glazed fresh, or cooke fruit on top after it comes out of the oven
