Lentil Curry Bowls with Cilantro Cashew Sauce

Sauce:
1/2 c fresh cilantro
3/4 c cashews (salted ok)
1/3 c water
1/4 tsp salt
juice of 2 limes
1 clove garlic (optional)
1-2 tsp honey

Puree all ingredients in a food processor or blender until smooth. Taste and adjust.

Carrots:
8-10 carrots, peeled and chopped into chunks
1 tbsp olive oil
1 tsp garam masala
1/2 tsp chili powder
salt to taste

Preheat oven to 450F. Toss all ingredients together and roast for 20-30 min or until golden brown.

Curry
1 c basmati rice
1 tbsp oil
1/2 c chopped onion
2 cloves garlic
2 tbsp red thai curry paste
1 tsp garam masala
1/2 tsp cumin seed
1 c brown lentils, rinsed
14 oz tomato puree
2 c chicken or vegetable broth
pinch of salt
avocado and cilantro for garnish

Heat the oil in a skillet over medium heat. Add the onion and garlic; saute for 3-5 min. Add the curry paste and spices; saute for 2-3 min. Add the lentils, tomato, and broth. Simmer until lots of the liquid has evaporated - continue adding 1/2 c of liquid as needed (the lentils will keep soaking it up). Repeat this process for about 30-45 min until the lentils are soft. Add the rice to the mixture; stir to combine, adding extra broth or water as necessary. Season with salt. Serve in bowls topped with roasted carrots, avocado slices, clinatro, and the cilantro cashew sauce.
