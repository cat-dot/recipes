San Marzano Pasta e Fagioli

1 lb chicken sausages in casing
1 1/2 c mirepoix - chopped carrot, celery, and onion
3 cloves garlic, minced
1 1/2 tsp ground oregano
1/2 tsp salt
1 bay leaf
28 oz can san marzano tomatoes
14 oz can cannellini beans
28 oz chicken broth
1 lb small pasta - ochiette
8 oz fresh baby spinach
shaved parmigiano reggiano cheese for garnish

Remove sausage from its casing. In a large pot, brown the sausage over medium high heat and drain the excess grease. Set aside. Crush the tomatoes and sauce in a food processor and set aside. Drain the cannellini beans. Place in a food processor, refill the can with water and add to the food processor, and puree until very smooth. In the same large pot, saute the mirepoix, garlic, oregano, salt, and bay leaf (add olive oil if needed) until soft and fragrant. Add the tomatoes, beans, and broth. Simmer for 20 min. Add the pasta and simmer for another 20 min until pasta is cooked through and sauce is reduced. Throw in the baby spinach and the sausage. If needed, add woater or broth to adjust the consistency of the pasta before serving. Top with cheese.
