Skillet Roaste Lemon Chicken
(Ina Garten)

2 tsp fresh thyme leaves
1 tsp whole fennel seeds
kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper
1/3 c olive oil
1 lemon, halved and sliced 1/4" thick
1 yellow onion, halved and sliced 1/4" thick
2 large garlic cloves, thinly sliced
1 4lb chicken, backbone removed and butterflied
1/2 c dry white wine ex Pinot Grigio
juice of 1 lemon

Preheat oven to 450F. Place the thyme, fennel seeds, 1 tbsp salt, and 1 tsp pepper in a mini food processor and process until ground. Pour the olive oil into a small glass measuring cup, stir in the herb mixture and set aside. Distribute the lemon slices in a 12" cast iron skillet and distribute the onion and garlic on top. Place the chicken, skin side down, on top of the onion and brush with 1/2 the oil mixture. Turn the chicken skin side up, pat dry with paper towels, and brush it all over with the rest of the oil. Roast the chicken for 30 min. Pour the wine into the pan (not on the chicken) and roast for another 10-15 min, until a meat thermometer inserted into the thickest part of the breast registers 155-160F. Remove the chicken from the oven, sprinkle it with the lemon juice, cover the skillet tightly with aluminum foil, and allow to rest for 10-15 min. Cut the chicken into quarters or eighths, sprinkle with salt, and serve hot with the pan juices, cooked lemon, and onion.
