Chewy Molasses Gingersnaps

2 1/4 c ap flour
1/4 tsp salt
1 tsp baking soda
1 tbsp ground ginger
1/2 tsp cinnamon
1/4 tsp ground cardamom
1/4 tsp ground cloves
3/4 c unsalted butter, softened
3/4 c light brown sugar
1 large eg
1/3 c molasses
1 tsp vanilla
1/2 c turbinado sugar

Preheat oven to 375F. Line a cookie sheet with parchment paper and set aside. In a medium bowl, whisk to combine the flour, salt baking soda, ginger, cinnamon, cardamom, and cloves; set aside. In the bowl of a stand mixer, cream the butter and brown sugar on medium high speed until pale and fluffy, ~3 min. Add the egg and mix to incorporate, then mix in the molasses and vanilla, scraping the bowl as needed. Reduce the mixer to low and add the flour mixture until just combined. Roll the dough into 1" balls toss in the turbinado sugar to coat and place on the baking sheet ~2" appart from each other. Gently press down on the dough balls to flatten them slightly. Bake until the bottoms and edges of the cookies are golden brown and set, and the tops begin to crack, 8-10 min. Remove the cookies from the oven and let them cool on the sheet for 5 min, then transfer to a wire rack to cool further before serving.
