Magic Chocolate Cake

Use a 20cm square cake tin, either silicone or greased with butter and lined with baking parchment

4 eggs, separated
80g caster sugar
70g brown sugar
1 tbsp water
125g butter
70g plain flour
pinch of salt
40g unsweetened cocoa powder
500ml milk at room temp

Preheat oven to 300F. Beat the egg yolks with the sugar and water until the mixture whitens. Melt the butter and pour it into the mixture. Then add the flour, cocoa, and salt. Beat for a few minutes more. Pour in the milk little by litte, whisking constantly. Beat the egg whites until stiff and, using a whisk, gently incorporate them into the batter.  Should still have lumps of egg white. Pour the batter into the cake tin and smooth the surface with the blade of a knife. Bake in the oven for 55 min. When the cake comes out of the oven it will wobble slightly. Before turning it out, leave it to set in the fridge for at least 2 hrs (overnight better).


For decoration, can use chocolate flakes from a bar & vegetable peeler.
Can also make a whipped chocolate ganache
100g melted dark chocolate
80ml warmed whipping cream
80ml chilled cream. 

Mix and set aside in the fridge for 2 hrs, then whip until it thickens.
