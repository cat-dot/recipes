1 1/4 c ap flour
1 c graham cracker crumbs
1 tsp kosher salt
2 sticks unsalted butter, softened
1/4 c sugar
3/4 c sweetened condensed milk
1 c dried coconut flakes
1/2 c pecans, roughly chopped

Preheat oven to 350F. In a medium bowl, whisk together the flour, graham cracker crumbs, and salt to incorporate. In the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with the paddle attachment, cream butter and sugar until light and fluffy, 2 min. Add the flour mixture and mix until a dough comes together. Transfer to a parchment lined 9" square pan and, using an offset spatula, spread in a even layer. Bake until lightly golden, 15 min, then remove from the oven. Pour the milk over the crust and spread evenly with offset spatula. In a medium bowl, mix together the coconut, pecans, and chips, then scatter the mixture over the milk and lightly press into the milk. Garnish with flaky sea salt. Bake until the coconut is golden brown, 20-25 min, then remove from the oven and let cool completely before cutting and serving.
