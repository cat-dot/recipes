Aquafaba
  --Ania - lazy cat kitchen

2 c dry chickpeas
8 c water

Soak chickpeas in water such that they are submerged for 8 hrs or overnight. Discard soaking water and rinse the chickpeas. Place chickpeas in large pot and cover with 8 c water; cover with lid and bring to a boil over medium heat. Skim the foam that accumulates and discard. After water comes to a boil, decrease heat to medium low and simmer until chickpeas are tender, ~60-75 min. Once chickpeas are ready, take off heat and let cool. Once everything is cool, remove chickpeas with slotted spoon. Depending on intended use of aquafaba, you may want to reduce liquid further, keeping in mind the more you reduce it, the more intense the chickpea flavor will be. To reduce, place back on medium low heat without lid for ~30-45 min. Let liquid cool to room temp and then transfer to clean, airtight container and store in the fridge. If making ahead of when you need it, store cooked chickpeas back in the liquid overnight - this will up the gelatinous properties of the aquafaba. Can be stored for 3-4 days in refrigerator or frozen up to 3 months.
