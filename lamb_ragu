  --Cook's Country

1 lb ground lamb
1 onion, chopped fine
2 carrots, peeled and chopped fine
4 garlic cloves, sliced thin
1 1/2 tsp ground fennel
1 tsp dried oregano
1/2 tsp salt 
1/2 tsp pepper
28 oz can crushed tomatoes
1 lb pappardelle
1/2 c torn fresh basil

Combine lamb, onions, carrots, garlic, fennel, oregano, salt, and pepper in 12" nonstick skillet. Cook over medium high heat, breaking up meat with wooden spoon, until meat is cooked through and carrots are tender, ~8 min. Stir in tomatoes and reduce heat to medium. Cook, covered, until sauce has thickened slightly, ~15 min. Meanwhile, bring 4 qt water to boil in large pot. Add pasta and 1 tbsp salt and cook, stirring often, until al dente. Reserve 1 c water, then drain pasta and return to pot. Add sauce and 1/4 c reserved water to pasta and toss to combine. Adjust consistency with remaining water as needed. Stir in basil and season with salt and pepper to taste. Serve.


Notes: Can sub tagliatelle for papperdelle. Serve with grated parmesan cheese.
