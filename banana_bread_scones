Banana Bread Scones
  --Samantha Seneviratne

1 extra-large, extra-ripe banana, mashed (1/2 c)
1/3 c heavy cream, plus more for brushing
1 large egg, lightly beaten
1 tsp pure vanilla extract
2 c ap flour
1/3 c packed dark brown sugar
2 1/2 tsp baking powder
1/2 tsp kosher salt
1/2 c (1 stick) cold unsalted butter, cut into roughly 1/2" pieces
2 1/4 oz semisweet chocolate, chopped (1/2 c)
1 1/4 oz hazelnuts, toasted, skinned, and finely chopped (~1/4 c)
Sanding sugar for sprinkling (or turbinado or granulated)

Heat the oven to 425F. In a small bowl, whisk together the banana, cream, egg, and vanilla. In a large bowl, whisk together the flour, brown sugar, baking powder, and salt. Cut in the butter with a pastry blender, or 2 knives used like scissors, until the mixture resembles coarse meal with some larger pieces. (You can use your fingers if you work fast enough that the butter stays cold.) Toss in the chopped chocolate and hazelnuts. Drizzle in the banana mixture and stir with a fork until the mixture is crumbly and moistened, but stop before you’ve mixed it into a uniform batter. Tip out the mixture onto a parchment-lined baking sheet and pat it into a craggy, 6" circle. Using a sharp knife or a bench scraper, cut the circle into 8 equal triangles. (At this point, you could freeze the triangles well-wrapped on their sheet for another day. Bake them from frozen.) Spread the triangles a good couple inches apart and brush the tops with the cream. Sprinkle with sanding sugar. Bake until the scones are golden brown and set, ~18-22 min. A toothpick inserted into the center of a scone should come out clean. Transfer the baking sheet to a wire rack to cool slightly. Serve warm or room temperature. Scones are best the day they’re made, but any leftovers can be frozen (or stale ones can be split in half and toasted in butter in a skillet to revive them).
