Jollof Rice
  - Kwame Onwuachi
  
1 tbsp minced ginger
1 tbsp Jamaican curry powder                       
1 tsp dried crayfish
10 garlic cloves
3 Maggi beef bouillon cubes
2 medium plum tomatoes, cored and diced
1 red bell pepper—stemmed, cored and roughly chopped;
1 red onion, roughly chopped
1 habanero, stemmed
3 tbsp red palm oil
3 c purée
4 c basmati rice
2 tsp kosher salt
6 c water

In a blender, purée the ginger, curry powder, dried crayfish, garlic, bouillon cubes, tomatoes, red pepper, red onion and habanero until smooth. In a medium saucepan, heat the palm oil over medium heat. Add the purée and bring to a simmer. Slowly cook until most of the liquid has reduced and the sauce has developed a sweetness, 20 min. Add the rice and salt, and cook, letting the rice begin to absorb the purée, 5 min. Add the water and bring to a boil, then reduce to a low simmer. Cook, covered, until all of the water has absorbed and the rice is fully cooked, 20-25 min. Remove from the heat and fluff with a fork, then serve.
