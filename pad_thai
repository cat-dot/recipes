Pad Thai

4 oz rice stick noodles (fettuccine width, or larger)
1/4 c peanut oil
1-4 tbsp tamarind paste
1/4 c fish sauce (nam pla)
1/3 c honey
2 tbsp rice vinegar
1/2 tsp red pepper flakes (or to taste)
1/4 c chopped scallions
1 garlic clove, minced
2 eggs
1 small head napa cabbage, shredded (~4 c)
1 c mung bean sprouts
1/2 lb peeled shrimp, pressed tofu, or a combination
1/2 c roasted peanuts, chopped
1/4 c chopped fresh cilantro
2 limes, quartered

Put noodles in a large bowl and add boiling water to cover. Let sit until noodles are just tender; check every 5 min or so to make sure they do not get too soft. Drain, drizzle with 1 tbsp oil to keep from sticking and set aside. Meanwhile, put 1 tbsp tamarind paste, fish sauce, honey, and vinegar in a small saucepan over medium low heat and bring just to a simmer. Taste and add more tamarind paste if desired. It should be piquant, but not unpleasantly sour. Stir in red pepper flakes and set aside. Put remaning 3 tbsl oil in large skillet over medium high heat; when oil shimmers, add scallions and garlic and cook for about a min. Add eggs to pan; once they begin to set, scramble them until just done. Add cabbage and bean sprouts and continue to cook until cabbage begins to wilt, then add shrimp or tofu (or both). When shrimp begin to turn pink and/or tofu begins to brown, add noodles to pan along with sauce. Toss everything together to coat and combine well. When noodles are warmed through, serve, sprinkling with peanuts and garnishing with cilantro and lime wedges.


Notes:
12oz rice noodels, 3-4 tbsp pure tamarind or 1 tbsp tamarind concentrate, 2 tbsp minced garlic.
