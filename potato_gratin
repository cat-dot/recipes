Potato Gratin

2 garlic cloves, smashed and divided
1 1/2 c heavy cream
1/2 c whole milk
1/4 c (1/2 stick) unsalted butter
10 parsley sprigs, tied together with butcher's twine
2 tsp kosher salt
1/4 tsp freshly grated black pepper
3 lbs russet potatoes, peeled and very thinly slived on a mandoline (4 medium)
2 c (4 1/2 oz) grated gruyere cheese

Preheat oven to 375F. Rub a 9x6" baking dish with 1 of the smashed garlic cloves. In a small saucepan, combine the cream, milk, butter, and parsley bundle. Mince the remaining garlic clove and add to the pot, along with the salt and pepper, and bring to a boil over medium heat, 5 min. Remove from the heat, let cool slightly and adjust the seasoning with salt to taste. Discard the parsley. Place the potato rounds in the prepared baking dish, overlapping each other in long rowa. Pour the warm milk mixture over the potatoes and sprinkle the cheese on top. Cover the dish with aluminum foil and bake until the potatoes are almost fork tender, 45-50 min. Remove the foil and continue to bake until the top is bubbling and golden brown, 15-20 min. Let cool for 5 min, then serve.
