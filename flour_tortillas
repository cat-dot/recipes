  --Cook's Country

2 c (10 oz) ap flour
1 1/4 tsp salt
5 tbsp vegetable shortening, cut into 1/2" chunks
2/3 c watm tap water
1 tsp vegetable oil

Combine flour and salt in large bowl. Using your fingers, rub shortening into flour mixture until mixture resembles coarse meal. Stir in warm water until combined. Turn dough out onto counter and knead briefly to form smooth, cohesive ball. Divide dough into 12 equal portions, about 2 tbsp each; roll each into smooth 1" ball between your hands. Transfer to plate, cover with plastic wrap, and refrigerate until dough is firm, at least 30 min or up to 2 days. Cut 12 6" squares of parchment paper. Roll 1 dough ball into 6" circle on lightly floured counter. Transfer to parchment square and set aside. Repeat with remaining dough balls, stacking rolled tortillas on top of each other with parchment squares between. Heat oil in 12" nonstick skillet over medium heat until shimmering. Wipe out skillet with paper towels, leaving thin film of oil on bottom. Place 1 tortilla in skillet and cook until surface begins to bubble and bottom is spotty brown, ~1 min. (If not browned after 1 min, turn heat up slightly. If browning too quickly, reduce heat.) Flip and cook until spotty brown on second side, 30-45 s. Transfer to plate and cover with clean dish towel. Repeat with remaining tortillas.

TO MAKE AHEAD: Cooled tortillas can be layered between parchment paper, covered with plastic wrap, and refrigerated for up to 3 days. To serve, discard plastic, cover tortillas with clean dish towel, and microwave at 50% power until heated through, about 20 s.
