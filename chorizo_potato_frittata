  --Cook's Illustrated
  
12 large eggs
1/3 c whole milk
salt
1 tbsp evoo
1 lb yukon gold potatoes, peeled and cut into 1/2" pieces
1/4 tsp cumin
6 oz spanish style chorizo, cut into 1/4" pieces
3 tbsp water
1 tsp sherry vinegar
1/2 c chopped fresh cilantro

Adjust oven rack to middle position and heat oven to 350F. Whisk eggs, milk, and 1/2 tsp salt in bowl until well combined. Heat oil in 12" ovesafe nonstick skillet over medium high heat until shimmering. Add potatoes, cumin, and 1/4 tsp salt; cook, stirring frequently, until half of potatoes are lightly browned, 8-10 min. Add chorizo, water, and vinegar, continue to cook, stirring constantly, until no water remains in skillet, ~1 min. Add cilantro and egg mixture and cook, using rubber spatula to stir and scrape bottom of skillet until large curds form and spatula leaves trail through eggs but eggs are still very wet, ~30 s. Smooth curs into even layer and cook, without stirring, for 30 s. Transfer skillet to oven and bake until frittata is slightly puffy and surface bounces back when lightly pressed, 6-9 min. Using rubber spatula, loosen frittata from skillet and transfer to cutting board. Let stand for 5 min before slicing and serving.


Notes: Spanish style chorizo is dry cured and needs only to be heated through.
