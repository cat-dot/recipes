Braised Chicken with Potatoes, Carrots, Mushrooms, and Peas

5 oz thick cut bacon, cut into 1/4" batons
1 tbsp canola oil
4 chicken legs (~2 1/4 lbs) skins removed, drumstick and thighs separated, patted dry
kosher salt to taste
3 tbsp ap flour
3/4 c dry white wine
1 1/2 c water
1/2 lb baby red potatoes
8 pearl onions, peeled
3 large carrots, cut into 2" pieces
2 garlic cloves, smashed and finely minced
5 thyme sprigs
freshly ground black pepper to taste
1/4 lb cremini mushrooms, halved or quarted if large
1 lb frozen baby peas, thawed
2 tbsp roughly chopped flat leaf parsley for garnish

In a large heavy-bottomed saucepan or dutch oven, heat the bacon and the oil over medium heat. Cook, stirring occasionally, until the fat renders and the bacon is crisp, 8 min. Using a slotted spoon, transfer the bacon to a paper towel lined plate. Set aside. Add the chicken legs to the pot, increase the heat to medium high and season with salt. Cook the chicken, turning occasionally, until brown on all sides, 10-12 min. Sprinkle with the flour and stir to distribute evenly, 1-2 min. Add the wine and reduce by half, 1-2 min. Add the water, potatoes, pearl onions, carrots, garlic, thyme, and reserved bacon. Season with more salt and pepper, and bring to a boil. Reduce the heat to medium, cover and cook until the chicken is cooked through and the vegetables are tender, 20-25 min. Add the mushrooms, cover and cooke for 5 more minutes. Stir in the peas and cook for another 2 min to heat through. Taste and adjust the seasoning.
