Crackle (aka brittle)

1/2 c granulated sugar
1/4 c packed light brown sugar
2 tbsp ap flour
1 1/4 tsp kosher salt
4 1/2 tbsp unsalted butter, melted
1/4 c heavy cream
2 large egg yolks
1/2 tsp vanilla
1 c. flavorful pantry items (ex. cereal, crackers, pretzels, chips, snack mix, granola, etc.)

Preheat oven to 350F. Line a 13"x18" rimmed baking sheet with a silicone mat. 
In a medium bowl, whisk together the sugars, flour, and salt. Add the butter, heavy cream, egg yolks, and vanilla, and whisk until smooth.
Pour the mixture into the baking pan and spread it out with a spatula to a 1/4" thickness. Crush and sprinkle your selected pantry items over the mixture. Bake for 16-18 min, until dark brown. Let cool completely, about 15 min.
Remove the crackle from the baking sheet and break into small pieces using a heavy rolling pin or mug. Eat right away or store in an airtight container for up to 1 month.
