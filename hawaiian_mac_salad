Hawaiian Mac Salad
  --Jess Larson

8 oz dry elbow macaroni or short pasta of choice
1 medium carrot, peeled as desired and grated
1 c mayo
1 tsp granulated sugar
1/2 tsp garlic powder
1/2 tsp onion powder
1/2 tsp paprika
1/4 tsp turmeric
optional: up to 1/4 tsp cayenne pepper
kosher salt and ground black pepper

Bring a large pot of water to a boil. Once boiling, generously salt the water. Add in the pasta and cook to al dente, according to package directions. Drain the pasta, rinsing with cold water, and set aside. Add cooled elbows to a large mixing bowl with the grated carrot, mayonnaise, sugar, garlic powder, onion powder, paprika, turmeric, and cayenne (if using). Season with 1 tsp kosher salt and ground black pepper, as desired. Stir to combine, seasoning with additional spices and/or salt as needed. 


Notes: Can use gf pasta. This is best served immediately upon dressing, though leftovers will keep for up to 3 days. Store the leftover macaroni salad in an airtight container in the refrigerator.
