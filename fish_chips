Fish & Chips

Tartar sauce:
3/4 c mayo
2 tbsp minced parsely
2 tbsp minced cornichons
2 tbsp mince capers
1 tbsp malt vinegar
1 tbsp lemon juice
1 tsp fine grated lemon zest
kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper to taste

Combine all ingredients & stir until smooth.

Fish & Chips:
vegetable oil for frying
4 medium (3 lbs) russet potatoes, cut into 1/2" batons and rinsed
1 1/2 c ap flour
1 tsp baking powder
1 tsp kosher salt + more to taste
1 1/2 c dark beer
2 lbs cod filets, cut into 5x1" strips

Preheat the oven to 250F. In a 6 quart dutch oven, heat 2" of oil to 275F and line 3 baking sheets with paper towels. Working in batches, blanch the potatoes in the oil until tender, but still pale in color, 6 min. Using a slotted spoon, transfer the potatoes to one of the prepared sheets to drain. Let cool completely in a single layer, allowing the fries to form a tacky skin. Increase the oil to 375F. Working in batches, fry the potatoes until golden brown and crisp, 3-4 min. Using a slotted spoon, transfer to the second prepared sheet to drain. Keep warm in the oven until ready to serve. In a medium bowl, whisk together the flour, baking powder, and salt until incorporated. Whisk in the beer until a smooth batter forms. Season the fish with salt, then, working in batches, dip the fish pieces into the batter and slowly drop into the fryer. Fry until golden brown and cooked through, 2-3 min, then transfer to the 3rd sheet to drain. Season immediately with salt.
Serve with tartar sauce, lemon wedges, and malt vinegar.
