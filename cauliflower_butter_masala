Cauliflower:
1 large cauliflower, cut into small florets
1/2 tsp kosher salt
1/2 tsp chili powder
1/2 tsp ground turmeric
2 tbsp sunflower oil

Heat the oven to 400F. Place the cauliflower florets on a baking sheet with the salt, ground spices, and sunflower oil, and mix well to coat. Roast for 20 min, until they start to turn golden brown at the tips. 

Curry:
2 tbsp sunflower oil
4 tbsp salted butter, divided
1 cinnamon stick
2 bay leaves
4 cardamom pods
1 tsp cumin seeds
2 onions, finely chopped
6 garlic cloves, finely chopped
1" piece ginger, peeled and finely chopped
14 oz can diced tomatoes
1/2 tsp kosher salt
1/2 tsp ground turmeric
1 tsp garam masala
1 tsp ground coriander
1 tsp kasuri methi (dried fenugreek leaves)
1 tsp honey
3 tbsp heavy cream

Heat the oil and 2 tbsp of butter over medium heat, then add the cinnamon, bay leaves, cardamom, and cumin. Let sizzle for a few seconds, then add the onions and cook over medium heat for 8 to 10 minutes, until the onions turn golden brown. Add the garlic and ginger and cook for another minute. Next, add the tomatoes, salt, and 1 cup of water. Cover and cook on low heat for 20-25 min. Add the turmeric, garam masala, coriander, fenugreek, honey, and 1 cup of water to the simmering tomato mixture and stir well. Add the roasted cauliflower, stir again to coat, then cover with a lid and cook for 10 minutes, until the cauliflower is cooked through. Add in the heavy cream and remaining 2 tbsp of butter, stir well to combine, and serve with naan or steamed rice.
