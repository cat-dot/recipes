Kombucha Muffins
  --Jerrelle Guy

3 c (360 g) white whole-wheat flour or spelt flour
4 tsp (10 g) baking soda
1/2 tsp salt
1/2 c (112 g) unsalted butter, melted, or neutral oil, plus more for greasing the pan
3/4 c (180 ml) agave or honey
16 oz (470 ml) bottle plain kombucha

Heat the oven to 425F (220C or gas mark 7). Oil the wells of a muffin tin and have it nearby. In a large bowl, whisk together the flour, baking soda, and salt. Pour the melted butter and agave over the dry ingredients, and then pour in the kombucha. Whisk the mixture until just combined. Donâ€™t mix beyond this point or your muffins will be tough. Immediately scoop the mixture into the muffin wells, and bake in the oven for 5 min. Then reduce the oven temperature to 375F (190C or gas mark 5) and finish cooking for another 8-10 min, or until a toothpick inserted into the center of a muffin comes out clean. The initial high heat of the oven will make sure the muffins pop out over the edges of the pan. Remove from the oven and allow to cool slightly. Serve warm with more softened butter, if you like.
