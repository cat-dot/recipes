Semolina Pudding

16 green cardamom pods, divided
4 c water
3/4 c sugar
1 c ghee
1 c semolina
1/2 c slivered almonds
1/2 c golden raisins
1/2 tsp kosher salt
creme fraiche for garnish

Crush 10 of the pods, transferring the seeds to a mortar and pestle; reserve the other 6 pods. Grind the seeds into a fine powder and set aside. In a medium saucepan, combine 6 reserved pod shells with the water and sugar, then bring to a boil. Once boiling, reduce the heat to low. Meanwhile, in a 6 quart dutch oven or wok, melt the ghee and the 6 reserved pods over medium high heat. Reduce the heat to medium and add the semolina. Cook, stirring constantly until toasted, 3-4 min. Add the almonds, raisins, and salt, and stir until the almonds are golden, 1-2 min. Skim the cardamom shells from the simmering water and slowly add to the semolina, stirring constantly. Cook until the pudding is thick and the semolina is tender, 3-4 min. Divide the pudding between bowls and garnish each with a spoonful of creme fraiche and the reserved cardamom powder, then serve.
