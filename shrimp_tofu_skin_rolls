Shrimp Tofu Skin Rolls
  --Jessica Kellgren-Fozard

450g raw shelled prawns
2 finely chopped spring onions
1/2 chicken stock cube
1/4 tsp salt
1/4 tsp pepper
1/2 tsp rice wine vinegar
1/2 tsp sesame oil
1 heaped tbsp rice flour
1 egg white
10 pieces tofu skin cut to 6x6"
oil for frying
worcestershire sauce/shoyu/chili oil for serving

Divide prawns in half. Roughly chop one half and mince the other. Mix all the prawns, spring onions, and seasonings together. If the mix is loose and not holding together, add a little more rice flour. Place a piece of tofu skin on a flat surface, rub with water on both sides and leave to soften. Do this with 3 pieces and by that time, the first will be ready to use. Scoop 1 tbsp of the filling onto the skin. Fold like a parcel and rub water around the edges to ensure sealing. Heat enough oil for frying in awok. When the oil is fully heated, turn down to medium and gently drop the rolls into the oil. Keep turning and fry until they golden brown on all sides. Place on plate lined with paper towels to absorb excess oil. Serve with condiment of choice.
