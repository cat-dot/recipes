Suya (Nigerian Mixed Grill)

Spice blend:
3 tbsp cayenne pepper
1 1/2 tbsp roasted peanuts, ground into a fine powder
1 tbsp smoked sweet paprika
1 tbsp garlic powder
1 tbsp onion powder
1/2 tbsp ground ginger
2 tsp kosher salt
2 maggi bouillon cubes, ground into a fine powder

In a small bowl, mix together all the ingredients until incorporated.

Suya:
1 lb jumbo shrimp, peeled and deveined
1 lb wagyu rib eye, thinly sliced into strips
1 lb boneless chicken thighs, cut into 2" pieces
12" bamboo skewers
lime wedges for serving
chopped parsley for garnish

In 3 separate bowls, place the shrimp, rib eye, and chicken respectively. Divide the spice blend between the proteins and mix well to coat. Cover each in plastic wrap and refrigerate for 1 hr.

Soubise:
2 medium vine-ripe tomatoes, stemmed
1 tbsp olive oil
kosher salt to taste
2 tbsp canola oil
1 medium white onion, thinly sliced
1 c heavy cream
1/2 c whole milk

Preheat oven to 400F. On a baking sheet, toss the tomatoes with the olive oil and salt. Transfer to the oven and roast for 15 min, then remove and let cool. In a large skillet, heat the canola oil over medium high heat. Add the onions and cook until soft and translucent, 6-8 min. Stir in the cream and milk, and bring to a light simmer. Cook, stirring occasionally, until lightly thickened, 15 min. Transfer to a blender and puree until smooth. Season with salt and set aside.

Light a grill. Skewer the proteins separately onto soaked bamboo skewers. Grill the skewers, turning occasionally, until cooked through, 2-3 min for shrimp, 2-3 min for rib eye, and 6-8 min for the chicken. Transfer meat to a platter and squeeze lime wedges over the meat. Garnish with parsley and serve alongside the roasted tomato soubise
