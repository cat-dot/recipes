Lomo Saltado

16 oz pkg frozen french fries (or make your own)
vegetable oil
1 lb beef tri tip, sliced 1/8-1/4" thick (or use lomo aka tenderloin)
salt and pepper to taste
1 large red onion, sliced into strips
3 large tomatoes, sliced into strips
1 yellow chili pepper (aji amarillo)
1/4 c white vinegar
dash shoyu to taste
2 tbsp chopped fresh parsley

Prep fries per instructions. Heat oil in frying pan over medium high heat. Season the meat with salt and pepper. Fry the meat until just cooked, and juices begin to release. Remove the meat from the pan, add onions and cook with additional oil as needed, until transparent. Stir in tomato and aji amarillo; cook until tomato softenes. Pour in vinegar and shoyu, stir, add beef back in. Add fries at last moment to keep crisp. Adjust seasoning as necessary. Sprinkle with parsley to serve.


Notes: (from Peruvian grandmother) Don't let juices release, stir fry in a wok with high heat. Use parsley AND cilantro. When adding meat back, it's only to coat with sauce and warm, 30s, do not overcook. Add garlic and cumin for more authentic flavor. Others suggest marinating meat in shoyu and vinegar (and possibly cumin/garlic) 30 min prior to stir fry. Can use aji amarillo paste if you can't find aji amarillo.
