Burnt Cheesecake
  --Molly Baz
  
2 lb cream cheese at room temp
1 1/2 c sugar
6 large eggs
2 c heavy cream
1 tsp kosher salt
1 tsp vanilla
1/3 c ap flour
unsalted butter for pan

Place rack in middle of oven; preheat to 400F. Butter pan, then line with 2 overlapping 16x12" sheets of parchment, making sure parchment comes at least 2" above top of pan on all sides. Place on rimmed baking sheet and set aside. Beat cream cheese and sugar in a stand mixer fitted with paddle attachment on medium low, scraping down sides of bowl as needed, until very smooth and sugar has dissolved, ~2 min. Increase speed to medium and add eggs, one at a time, beating each egg 15 s before adding the next. Scrape down sides of bowl, then reduce speed to medium low. Add cream, salt, and vanilla and beat until combined, ~30 s. Turn off mixer and sift flour evenly over mixture. Beat on low until incorporated, ~15 s. Scrape down sides of bowl and continue to beat until batter is very smooth, homogenous, and silky, ~10 s. Pour into prepared pan. Bake until deeply golden brown on top and still very jiggly in the center, 60-65 min. Let cool slightly, then unmold. Let cool completely. Carefully peel away parchment, slice, and serve. Cheesecake can be made 1 day ahead, cover and chill. Be sure to let cheesecake come to room temp before serving.
