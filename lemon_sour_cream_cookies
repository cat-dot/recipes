3 c ap flour
1 tsp baking powder
1/2 baking soda
1/4 tsp salt
16 tbsp unsalted butter, softened (2 sticks)
1 1/2 c sugar
2 large eggs
1 c sour cream

Adjust oven racks to upper middle and lower middle position and heat to 375F. Line 2 baking sheets with parchment paper. Whisk flour, baking powder, baking soda, and salt in large bowl. With electric mixer of medium high speed, beat butter and sugar until light and fluffy, ~2 min. Add eggs, one at a time, and mix until combined. Reduce speed to medium low. Mix in sour cream and zest. Add flour mixture and mix until incorporated. Refrigerate until slightly firm, ~1 hr. Drop rounded tbsp of dough onto prepared baking sheets, spacing cookies 2" apart. Bake until just golden around edges, ~15 min, switching and rotating sheets halfway through. Cool on baking sheets. Repeat with remaining dough. Combine cream cheese and lemon juice in medium bowl. Whisk in confectioners' sugar until smooth. Top each cooled cookie with 1 tsp glaze. Serve. Cookies can be stored in airtight container at room temp for 3 days.
