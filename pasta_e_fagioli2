Pasta e Fagioli

3 tbsp olive oil + more for garnish
2 oz pancetta, minced
1 carrot, peeled and finely chopped
1 celery stalk, finely chopped
1 yellow onion, peeled and finely chopped
2 tbsp tomato paste
1 tbsp minced fresh rosemary
3 garlic cloves, peeled and thinly sliced
2 c dried white beans, soaked overnight
10 c chicken stock
1 c small pasta shells
1 tbsp minced fresh sage leaves + whole leaves for garnish
kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper to taste
grated pecorino romano for garnish

In a large pot or dutch oven, heat the olive oil over medium high heat. Add the pancetta, carrot, celery, and onion, and cook until golden brown, 10 min. Add the tomato paste, rosemary, and garlic, and cook until the paste is caramelized and the rosemary and garlic are fragrant, another 2 min. Drain the soaked beas and add to the pot along with the stock. Bring to a boil, then reduce the heat to a simmer. Cook, stirring occasionally, until the beans are tender, 45-50 min. Add the pasta and cook another 10 min. Stir in the sage and season with salt and pepper. Serve, garnishing with the whole sage leaves and cheese.
