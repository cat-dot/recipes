Miso Mushroom Risotto
  --America's Test Kitchen

4 c chicken or vegetable broth
3 c water
1/3 c white miso
1/4 c evoo, divided
1 lb cremini mushrooms, trimmed and sliced 1/4" thick
1 onion, chopped fine
4 garlic cloves, minced
1 oz dried porcini mushrooms, rinsed and minced
2 c arborio rice
1/2 c dry white wine
1/4 c chopped fresh parsley

Bring broth, water, and miso to boil in large saucepan over high heat.; reduce heat to medium-low and simmer, whisking occasionally, until miso is dissolved, ~5 min. Reduce heat to lowest setting and cover to keep warm. Meanwhile, heat 1 tbsp oil in Dutch oven over medium heat until shimmering. Add cremini mushrooms, cover, and cook until mushrooms have released their liquid, ~5 min. Uncover and continue to cook until well browned, 10-12 min longer; transfer to bowl. Heat 2 tbsp oil in now-empty pot over medium heat until shimmering. Stir in onion and cook until softened, ~5 min. Add garlic and porcini mushrooms and cook until fragrant, ~30 s. Add rice and cook, stirring frequently, until grains are translucent around edges, ~3 min. Add wine and cook, stirring constantly, until fully absorbed, 2-3 min. Stir in 5 c hot broth mixture, then reduce heat to medium-low, cover, and simmer until almost all liquid has been absorbed and rice is just al dente, 16-18 min, stirring twice during simmering. Add 3/4 c hot broth mixture and browned cremini mushrooms to risotto and stir gently and constantly until risotto becomes creamy, ~3 min. Cover pot and let sit off heat for 5 min. Stir in parsley and remaining 1 tbsp oil and season with salt and pepper to taste. Before serving, adjust consistency with additional broth mixture as needed.
