Crostini with Mushroom-Stem Duxelles

1 baguette, sliced on the diagonal into 1/2" slices
1 tbsp evoo
1 tbsp unsalted butter
1 medium shallot, finely chopped
1 garlic clove, finely copped
1 1/2 c finely diced cremini mushroom stems (from 8oz of mushrooms)
2 sprigs fresh thyme, leaves removed and stems discarded
1/4 c dry white wine
salt and freshly ground black pepper
finely grated zest of one medium lemon
8 oz fresh whole milk ricotta

Preheat oven to 350F. Arrange the baguette slices on a baking sheet and drizzle 1 tbsp oil. Bake until crips and beginning to brown, ~10 min. In a medium skillet, melt the butter. Add the shallot and garlic and cook until translucent, ~5-7 min. Stir in the mushroom and thyme and cook over low heat, stirring frequently until the mixture is dry, ~15 min. Add the wine, bring the heat to medium low and continue to cook until all the liquid disappears, ~10 min. Season to taste with salt and pepper. In a medium bowl, combine the lemon zest and cheese. Season with salt and pepper. Spread the mixture evenly over the toasted bread and top each slice with a tablespoon of the mushrooms. Serve warm or at room temp.
