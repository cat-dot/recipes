Pad Thai

8 oz pad thai rice noodles
1 tbsp tamarind paste
1 tbsp fish sauce
1 tbsp lime juice
1 tbsp grated palm sugar (or light brown sugar)
pinch red pepper flakes
3 tbsp oil
2 minced garlic cloves
2 scallions, thinly sliced, greens reserved for garnish
1" piece ginger, peeled and minced
1 c broccoli florets
8 oz medium shrimp, peeled and deveined
1 c bean sprouts
4 oz pressed tofu, julienned
2 eggs, beaten
chopped roasted peanuts, for garnish
lime wedges for serving

In a medium bowl, cover the noodles with boiling water. Let sit until tender, 15-20 min, then drain. In a small bowl, whisk together the tamarind, fish sauce, lime juice, sugar and pepper flakes. In a wok, heat the oil over medium-high heat. Add the garlic, scallions and ginger, and cook, stirring constantly until aromatic, 1-2 min. Add the broccoli and cook until tender, 3-4 min. Add the shrimp, bean sprouts and tofu, and cook until the shrimp is opaque, 2-3 min. Push the contents to one side of the wok and pour the eggs onto the other side. Quickly scramble the eggs until set, about 1 min, then incorporate with the vegetables and shrimp. Add the noodles and the reserved tamarind mixture, and toss until evenly coated and the sugar has dissolved, 2 min. Serve, garnish with peanuts and lime wedges.
