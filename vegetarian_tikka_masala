Vegetarian Tikka Masala         gf
  --Kelli Foster, the Kitchn
  
2 tbsp ghee or olive oil
1 large yellow onion, diced
1 tbsp peeled and finely chopped fresh ginger
3 cloves garlic, minced
2 tbsp garam masala
2 tsp ground coriander
1 tsp paprika
Pinch cayenne pepper
1 1/2 tsp kosher salt
2 tbsp tomato paste
1 small head cauliflower (~2 lb), cut into bite-size florets
1 lb carrots (3-4 large), peeled and cut into 1/2" pieces
15 oz can crushed tomatoes
1 c low-sodium vegetable broth
1 c frozen peas
1 c heavy cream or unsweetened full-fat coconut milk
Cooked basmati rice, for serving
Fresh cilantro leaves and tender stems, for garnish

Heat the ghee or oil in a high-sided 12" skillet over medium until shimmering. Add the onion, ginger, and garlic and stir to coat. Add the garam masala, coriander, paprika, cayenne, and salt and cook, stirring occasionally, until the onion is softened, ~10 min. Add the tomato paste, stir to coat the aromatics, and cook for 1 min. Add the cauliflower and carrots and stir well to coat with spices. Add the tomatoes and broth and stir to combine, scraping up the fond from the bottom of the bottom of the pan. Bring to a boil. Reduce the heat to low, cover, and simmer until the vegetables are just tender, 20-25 min. Stir in the peas and cream and simmer uncovered, stirring occasionally, until thickened, 10-15 min. Serve over basmati rice and top with cilantro.



Notes: Leftovers can be refrigerated in a covered container for up to 4 days or frozen for 3 months. I sub Indian chili powder for cayenne, using ~2 tsp (or more). Have made with "normandy" frozen veggies in place of cauliflower and carrots.
