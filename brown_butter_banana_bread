Brown Butter Banana Bread

10 tbsp unsalted butter, divided
3 large ripe bananas, mashed + 1 halved lengthwise for decoration
3 large eggs
2 cp ap flour
1 c dark brown sugar + more for coating
2 tsp baking powder
1 tsp ground cinnamon
1 tsp kosher salt
½ tsp ground nutmeg

Preheat the oven to 350˚. Grease a 9x5" loaf pan with cooking spray. In a light-colored sauté pan, brown the butter and set aside. In a small bowl, reserve 2 tbsp of the browned butter for basting; let cool slightly. In a medium bowl, mix the mashed bananas with the eggs until fully incorporated. In a separate medium bowl, whisk together the flour, brown sugar, baking powder, cinnamon, salt and nutmeg. Using your hands, break apart any large clumps of sugar that remain. Pour the banana mixture into the dry ingredients and mix together until just combined. Pour in the 8 tbsp of melted brown butter and stir until fully incorporated. Transfer the batter to the prepared loaf pan. Dip the 2 banana halves in some brown sugar cut-sides down; dust off any excess sugar. Place the sugared bananas in the batter cut-sides up and bake until a toothpick inserted into the middle of the loaf comes out clean, 55-60 min. Once the banana bread has finished cooking, brush the top with the 2 tablespoons of reserved browned butter. Allow the banana bread to cool; serve slightly warm or completely cooled.
