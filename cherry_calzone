Cherry Calzone

2 c pitted and halved Northwest fresh sweet cherries
1/2 c sugar
2 tbsp lemon juice
1 tsp grated lemon peel
1 tsp ground cinnamon
4 oz lowfat cream cheese
1/2 tsp almond extract
3 tbsp toasted sliced almonds
2 tbsp milk
Cinnamon Sugar (optional) - 1/4 c sugar + 1 tsp cinnamon
hot roll dough (original recipe calls for 16oz pkg mix)

Combine cherries, sugar, lemon juice, lemon peel, and cinnamon. Mix cream cheese and almond extract. Mix cream cheese and almond extract. Divide dough into 8 equal pieces. Flatten into 6" rounds. Spoon 1/4 c cherry mixture onto one half of each round. Top with 1 tbsp cream cheese and 1 tsp almonds. Fold dough in half and seal edges. Pierce tops with a fork to allow steam to escape. Brush with milk; sprinkle each with 1/2 tsp cinnamon sugar if desired. Bake at 350F for ~15-20 min or until golden brown


Hot Roll Dough
2x 1/4 oz packages dry yeast
2 c warm water
4 tbsp sugar
4 1/2 c sifted flour + more for kneading
2 tsp salt
2 eggs
4 tbsp soft shortening

Dissolve yeast in water. Stir sugar, salt, and 1/2 flour into the yeast mix. Beat in the eggs and shortening. Add the remaining flour and beat until smooth. Scrape down the sides of the bowl and cover with a cloth. Let rise in a warm place until doubled in bulk (~30 min). Stir down the dough. Add more sifted flour until it can be worked with hands (add gradually). Knead a few times; just get it worked in and ready to pinch off into rolls.

If making just the rolls/bread (makes 2 loaves), allow to rise again before baking. Bake at 375-400 for 15-20 min.

Notees: can end up using 2 tbsp yeast and up to 6 c flour
