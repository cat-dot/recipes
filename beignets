  --Cook's Country

1 c water heated to 110F
3 tbsp sugar
1 tbsp instant or rapid rise yeast
3 c (15 oz) ap flour
3/4 tsp salt
2 large eggs
2 tbsp + 2 quarts vegetable oil
confectioners' sugar

Combine water, 1 tbsp sugar, and yeast in large bowl and let sit until foamy, ~5 min. Combine flour, remaining 2 tbsp sugar, and salt in second bowl. Whisk eggs and 2 tbsp oil into yeast mixture. Add flour mixture and stir vigorously with rubber spatula until dough comes together. Cover bowl with plastic wrap and refrigerate until nearly doubled in size, ~1 hr. Set wire rack inside rimmed baking sheet. Line second sheet with parchment paper and dust heavily with flour. Place half of dough on well floured surface, flipping to coat with flour. Roll out dough into 1/4" thick rectangle, roughly 12x9". Using pizza wheel, cut dough into 12 3" squares and transfer to floured sheet. Repeat with remaining dough. Add enough of remaining 2 qt oil to large dutch oven to measure ~1 1/2" deep and heat over medium high heat to 350F. Place 6 beignets in oil and fry until golden brown, ~3 min, flipping halfway through. Adjust burner if necessary, to maintain oil temp between 325-350F. Using slotted spoon or spider, transfer beignets to prepared wire rack. Return oil to 350F and repeat with remaining. Dust with confectioners' sugar. Serve immediately.
