Spicy Pumpkin Seed Brittle

3/4 c sugar
1/4 c light corn syrup
3 tbsp water
3 tbsp unsalted butter
1 c raw shelled pumpkin seeds (pepitas)
3/4 tsp baking soda
1/2 tsp salt
1/8 tsp cinnamon
1/8 tsp cayenne
1/4 tsp coarse sea salt

Using a wooden spoon, stir the sugar, corn syrup, and water in a medium heavy bottom saucepan over medium high heat until the sugar melts, ~3 min. Adjust the heat to medium low and continue to stir until the sugar has become a light golden brown, ~12-14 min. Add the butter and allow it to melt, then add the pumpkin seeds. Cook, stirring constantly, until golden brown, ~3 min. Add the baking soda, salt, cinnamon, and cayenne and stir for 1 min. Pour the mixture onto a parchment lined baking sheet coated with nonstick spray. Spread the brittle into an even layer using a rubber spatula. Sprinkle the coarse sea salt on top and allow to cool at room temp until completely hardeded, ~1 hr. Once cooled, break into bite size pieces. Can be kept up to 1 week in an airtight container.
