Vegan Brownies
  --America's Test Kitchen

2 c (10 oz) ap flour
1 tsp baking powder
3/4 tsp salt
1 c boiling water
3 oz unsweetened chocolate, chopped fine
3/4 c (2 1/4 oz) Dutch-processed cocoa powder
1 1/2 tsp instant espresso powder
2 1/2 c (17 1/2 oz) organic sugar
1/2 c vegetable oil
1 tbsp vanilla extract
1/2 c (3 oz) bittersweet or semisweet chocolate chips

Adjust oven rack to lowest position and heat oven to 350F. Make foil sling for 13x9" baking pan by folding 2 long sheets of aluminum foil; first sheet should be 13" wide and second sheet should be 9" wide. Lay sheets of foil in pan perpendicular to each other, with extra foil hanging over edges of pan. Push foil into corners and up sides of pan, smoothing foil flush to pan. Grease foil. Whisk flour, baking powder, and salt together in bowl. Whisk boiling water, unsweetened chocolate, cocoa, and espresso powder, if using, in large bowl until well combined and chocolate is melted. Whisk in sugar, oil, and vanilla. Using rubber spatula, stir flour mixture into chocolate mixture until combined; fold in chocolate chips. Scrape batter into prepared pan and smooth top. Bake until toothpick inserted halfway between edge and center comes out with few moist crumbs attached, 30-35 min. Let brownies cool in pan on wire rack for 2 hr. Using foil overhang, lift brownies from pan. Return brownies to wire rack and let cool completely, ~1 hr. Cut into squares and serve. (Brownies can be stored at room temperature for up to 4 days.)


Notes: If you use a glass baking dish, let the brownies cool for 10 minutes and then remove them from the dish.
