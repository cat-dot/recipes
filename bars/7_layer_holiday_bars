7 Layer Holiday Bars
  --Claire Saffitz

12 oz Biscoff cookies, pulverized into crumbs
8 tbsp unsalted butter, melted and cooled
1 large egg, white and yolk separated
Kosher salt
12 oz bag fresh cranberries
1 c chopped walnuts
1/2 c chopped crystallized ginger (2.5 ounces)
2/3 c old fashioned rolled oats
14 oz can sweetened condensed milk 
1 tsp vanilla
1/4 tsp ground cinnamon
1 1/2 c dried flaked unsweetened coconut

Preheat oven to 350F. In a 9x13" baking dish combine crumbs, butter, and yolk until fully incorporated; press into an even crust. Bake until it smells toasty and firm to the touch, ~15 min. Meanshile, combine the condensed milk, vanilla, cinnamon, and egg white in a small bowl; whisk to combine. Once the crust is done and slightly cooled, start layering with the cranberries, then walnuts, ginger, oats, milk mixture, finally top with the coconut. Cover loosely with foil and bake for ~10 min, then remove the foil and bake for another ~13 min. Let cool for at least an hour, preferably in the refrigerator, before cutting into them.


Notes: can sub other things for the layers (i.e. dried apricots for the ginger)
