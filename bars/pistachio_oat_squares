Pistachio Oat Squares                        gf
  --Jeanine Donofrio

1 c raw shelled pistachios
1 c rolled oats
1/2 tsp sea salt
1/4 c maple syrup, more for drizzling on top
2 tablespoons olive oil
1/4 c unsweetened coconut flakes
additional handful of chopped pistachios for the topping


Preheat the oven to 350F and line an 8" square pan with parchment paper. In a food processor, process the pistachios, oats, and salt for ~30 s, until a meal starts to form. Drizzle in the maple syrup and olive oil while the motor is still running and the meal begins to come together into a crumbly, almost-wet dough. Press the dough evenly into the pan and cover it with coconut flakes and remaining pistachios. Bake for 10-12 min until the coconut is nice and golden brown and the dough is cooked through. You want the squares to still be a little soft - don't overbake these. Carefully lift the cooled dough out of the pan by holding two sides of the parchment paper. Cut it into squares. Drizzle a little maple syrup over the top for extra sweetness, if you like. Store the squares in a sealed container for up to a week.
