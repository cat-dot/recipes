Lemon Brownies
  --Tawnie Graham

Brownies:
1/2 c butter (unsalted)
4oz white chocolate bar (Ghirardelli)
3/4 c sugar
2 tbsp lemon zest (~2 large lemons)
2 large eggs (room temperature)
1 large egg yolk (room temperature )
1 tsp lemon extract
1 tsp vanilla 
1 c + 2 tbsp ap flour (spooned and leveled )
1/2 tsp salt
1/8 tsp baking powder
2 tbsp fresh lemon juice

Preheat the oven to 350F. Line an 8×8" light colored aluminized steel baking pan with parchment paper. Set aside. Place the butter and white chocolate in a microwave-safe bowl. Microwave for 1 min (cover with a paper towel to prevent splatter), then stir. Continue heating in ~15-30 s increments, stirring between, until the mixture is melted and smooth but not scorched. Remove from the microwave, allow to cool slightly. Add the sugar and lemon zest in a large mixing bowl. Rub the sugar and lemon zest between your fingertips to create a lemon sugar. This helps release the natural oils and infuses more lemon flavor into the brownies. Add the eggs and extracts and whisk for ~1 min. Pour in the white chocolate/butter mixture and fold until combined. Add in the flour, salt, and baking powder. Fold a few times. Then add the lemon juice last. Add in the flour, salt, and baking powder. Fold a few times. Then add the lemon juice last. Pour batter into prepared pan. Bake for ~25-30 min. The edges will look golden brown (the tops won't be browned), and a toothpick inserted in the center should come out mostly clean; a few moist crumbs are OK. As always, be careful not to over-bake. Allow to cool completely. 


Glaze:
1 c powdered sugar
2 tbsp fresh lemon juice

Whisk/stir together the powdered sugar and lemon juice in a small bowl. It should be thick, but pourable. Spread over the cooled lemon brownies with an offset spatula. Garnish with lemon zest on top (optional) and allow to set up for ~15-30 min before slicing and enjoying…if you can wait! 🤣 Store at room temperature for 2-3 days, or a week in the refrigerator.
