Banana Berry Oat Bars

Topping:
2 c (330g) finely minced fresh or frozen strawberries
1 tbsp honey
1/4 medium lemon, juiced

Combine berries with 1 honey and juice (if using frozen, thaw first). Toss until well combined. Set aside in fridge to chill for at least 20 min.

Bars:
2 c (160g) uncooked rolled oats, divided
1 tsp baking powder
2 tsp cinnamon
2 medium (260g) ripe bananas, mashed (~1c)
2 tsp vanilla 
2 tbsp honey, divided

Preheat oven to 375F. In a food processor, process 1 c oats until it reaches a flour like consistency and transfer to a large mixing bowl. Add remaining oats, baking powder, cinnamon, banana, vanila, and remaining honey. Stir until well combined. Line an 8x8" baking dish with parchment paper. Transfer 1/2-2/3 of oat mixture into baking dish and press with spatula. Strain liquid from berry mixture and spread in a single layer over the oats. Crumble remaining oat mixture on top. Bake for 30-35 min or until the top is golden brown. Remove and cool before cutting. 
Note: can replace berry topping for low/no sugar jam.
