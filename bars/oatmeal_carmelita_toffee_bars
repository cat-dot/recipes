1 tsp vanilla
3/4 tsp (0.75 tsp) salt
1/2 tsp (0.5 tsp) baking soda
1 c (140 g) ap flour

3/4 c (135 g) milk chocolate chips
1/2 c (90 g) semi sweet chocolate chips
1/4 c (59.15 g) toffee bits heath bar
6 oz (170.1 g) caramel kraft bits, homemade or from the jar
2 tbsp heavy whipping cream
flaked sea salt for topping

Preheat the oven to 350 F. Grease a 8x8" pan with cooking spray, and line with parchment. In a large mixing bowl fitted with the paddle attachment, cream together butter, brown sugar and vanilla until light and fluffy. Add salt, baking soda, flour and oats, mixing until combined. Press half the dough onto the bottom of the pan. Bake for 8 min. While bars bake, melt caramel and cream together in the microwave. Cook in 30 s increments, stirring in between until mixed and melted. Top the warm bottom layer of the bars with both chocolate chips and toffee bits, followed by warm caramel sauce. Place dollops of remaining dough on top, don’t worry about it spreading evenly over the top. Bake an additional 15-17 min, or until the edges are a golden brown and the caramel is bubbling. Remove from oven and sprinkle with flaked salt. For best results, let cool completely before cutting.


Notes: doubled this recipe bake it in a 9x13" pan instead. The doing so add 2-3 min to each part of the baking.
