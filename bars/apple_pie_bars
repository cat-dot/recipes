Apple Pie Bars
(Ina Garten)

Crust:
1 lb (4 sticks) unsalted butter at room temp
3/4 c granulated sugar
1/2 c light brown sugar, lightly packed
2 tsp vanilla
4 c ap flour
1 1/2 tsp kosher salt
1/2 c chopped walnuts
1 tsp cinnamon

Preheat oven to 375F. Place the butter, sugars, and vanilla in the bowl of an electric mixer fitted with the paddle attachment and beat on medium for 2 min, until light and creamy. Sift the flour and salt together and, with the mixer on low, slowly add to the butter mixture, beating until combined. Scatter 2/3 of the dough in clumps in a 9x13" baking pan and press it lightly with floured hands on the bottom and 1/2" up the sides. Refrigerated for 20 min. Bake for 18-20 min, until the crust is golden brown, and set aside to cool. Put the mixing bowl with the remaining dough back on the mixer, add the walnuts and cinnamon, and mix on low to combine. Set aside.

Filling:
1 1/2 lbs granny smith apples, peeled, quartered, cored, and sliced 1/8" thick (3 large)
1 1/2 lbs golden delicious apples, peeled, quartered, cored, and sliced 1/8" thick (3 large)
2 tbsp freshly squeezed lemon juice
1/4 c granulated sugar
1 tsp cinnamon
1/8 tsp nutmeg
4 tbsp (1/2 stick) unsalted butter

Reduce the oven to 350F. Combine the apples and lemon juice in a very large bowl. Add the sugar, cinnamon, and nutmeg and mix well. Melt the butter in a large (10" diameter) pot, add the apples, and simmer over medium to medium low heat, stirring often, for 12-15 min, until the apples are tender and the liquid has mostly evaporated. Spread the apples evenly over the crust, leaving a 1/2" border. Pinch medium pieces of the remaining dough with your fingers and drop them evenly on top of the apples. Bake for 25-30 min, until the topping is browned. Cool completely and cut into bars.
