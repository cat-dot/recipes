Scottish Macaroon Bars

4 oz potato (preferrably russet)
1 lb (16oz) powdered sugar (more or less as needed)
dark or milk chocolate for dipping
finely shredded coconut for coating

Boil the unpeeled potato. Drain, peel and mash the potato and allow to cool completely. Begin adding powdered sugar, ~ 1/2 c at a time. Don't fret if the mixture becomes gooey, because it will. Just keep adding the sugar and mixing well, and soon it will have a fondant texture. Add enough sugar so that it comes together and is very stiff. Prepare a cookie sheet which will fit into your freezer with waxed paper or a silpat. You can either roll the mixture and flatten, or shape into a rectangle on the sheet and place in the freezer for ~4hrs or longer. Prepare the coconut by placing it on a cookie sheet in a preheated 300F oven for 5 min. Stir the coconut and continue to monitor closely as it will turn brown very quickly. Remove from the oven when it's a nice brown color; cool and mix with an equal amount of untoasted coconut. Place in a plate which will be a good size for dipping the macaroons. When you are ready to finish the macaroons, melt the chocolate. Dip each piece into the chocolate and immediately coat with the coconut. Place on a tray to set. Once the chocolate has hardened, there is no need to freeze or refrigerate the macaroons. Keep in a cool, dry place and consume within 7-10 days.
