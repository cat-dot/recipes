Lemon Bars
  --America's Test Kitchen

Crust:
1 c (5 oz) ap flour
1/4 c (1 3/4 oz) sugar
1/2 tsp salt
8 tbsp unsalted butter, melted

Adjust oven rack to middle position and heat oven to 350F. Make foil sling for 8" square baking dish, making sure foil is flush with pan and smooth. Whisk flour, sugar, and salt together in bowl. Add butter and stir until combined. Transfer mixture to pan and press into even layer over entire bottom. Bake crust until dark golden brown 19-24 min, rotating pan halfway through baking.

Filling:
1 c (7 oz) sugar
2 tbsp ap flour
2 tsp cream of tartar
1/4 tsp salt
3 large eggs + 3 large yolks
2 tsp grated lemon zest + 2/3 c juice (4 lemons)
4 tbsp unsalted butter, cut into 8 pieces
confectioners' sugar (optional)

Whisk sugar, flour, cream of tartar, and salt together in same bowl used for crust. Whisk in eggs and yolks until no streaks of egg remain. Whisk in lemon zest and juice. Transfer mixture to saucepan and cook over medium low heat, stirring constantly, until mixture thickens and registers 160F, 5-8 min. Off heat, stir in butter. Strain filling through fine mesh sieve. Pour filling over hot crust and tilt pan to spread evenly. Bake until filling is set and barely jiggles when pan is shaken, 8-12 min. Let bars cool completely, at least 1 1/2 hrs. Using sling, lift bars out of pan and transfer to cutting board. Cut into bars, wiping knife clean between cuts as necessary. Optionally dust bars with confectioners' sugar before serving.
