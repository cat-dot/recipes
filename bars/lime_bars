Lime Bars
  --Amber Brady

Crust:
1 c (120 g) ap flour
1/4 c (30 g) powdered sugar
1/4 tsp salt
1/2 c (113 g) butter, (cut into 8 pieces)

Preheat oven to 350F. Lightly grease or line an 11×7" baking dish with parchment paper that overhangs 2" on both sides. Combine the flour, powdered sugar, salt and butter in a food processor. Pulse until mixture resembles fine crumbs. Press into prepared pan and bake for 18-20 min, or until golden brown.

Filling:
1 1/4 c (250 g) sugar
1/4 c (30 g) ap flour
4 large eggs
2 tsp lime zest
2/3 c (159 ml) fresh lime juice
drop of green (+ yellow) food coloring, optional

Whisk together the sugar and flour in a bowl. Add the eggs, one at a time, whisking well after each addition. Add the zest, lime juice, and a drop of green (+ yellow) food coloring, if desired. Mix until everything is smooth and combined. Pour filling over hot crust and return to oven to bake for an additional 18-20 min or until set. When done, the filling will no longer jiggle. Let cool completely in the pan, ~1 hr. Then refrigerate for 1-2 hr and serve cold. Lift bars out of pan with parchment paper for easy cutting and serving. Store leftovers in the refrigerator.
