Grasshopper Pie
  --Cook's Country

Crust:
16 oreo mint n creme cookies, broken into rough pieces
3 tbsp unsalted butter, melted and cooled

Adjust oven rack to middle position and heat oven to 350F. Grind cookies in food processor to fine crumbs. Transfer to bowl, drizzle with butter, and toss well. Press crumbs evenly into bottom and sides of 9" pie plate and refrigerate until firm, ~20 min. Bake until set, 8-10 min. Cook completely on wire rack.

Filling:
3 large egg yolks
1 envelope unflavored gelatin
1/2 c sugar
2 c heavy cream
pinch salt
1/4 c green creme de menthe
1/4 c white creme de cacao

Beat egg yolks in medium bowl. Combine gelatin, sugar, 1/2 c cream, and salt in medium saucepan and let site until gelatin softenes, ~5 min. Cook over medium heat until gelatin dissolves and mixture is very hot but not boiling, ~2 min. Whisking vigorously, slowly add gelatin mixture to yolks. Return mixture to saucepan and cook, stirring constantly, until slightly thickened, ~2 min. Remove from heat and add creme de menthe and creme de cacao. Pour into clean bowl and refrigerate, stirring occasionally, until wobbly but not set, ~20 min. Beat reamining 1 1/2 c cream with electric mixer to stiff peaks. Whisk 1 c whipped cream into gelatin mixture until completely incorporated. Using rubber spatula, fold gelatin mixture into remaining whipped cream until no streaks of white remain. Scrape mixture into cooled pie shell, smooth top, and refrigerate until firm, at least 6 hr or preferrably overnight. The pie will keep tightly wrapped in refrigerator for up to 2 days. Serve.


Notes: To avoid grainy texture, start beating cream slowly and increase mixer speed once the cream begins to build in volume.
