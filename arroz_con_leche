Arroz Con Leche

2 c long grain white rice
8 c whole milk
3/4 c granulated sugar
12 oz can evaporated milk
1 vanilla bean, split
2 small cinnamon sticks
ground cinnamon for topping

Fill a medium pot halfway with water and bring to a boil. Remove from heat and add rice. Set aside 20 min. Meanwhile, combine milks, sugar, vanilla bean, and cinnamon stick in a large heavy bottomed pot (at least 4 quarts) and set over medium heat. Cook, stirring occasionally, 40 min. If mixture starts to boil, reduce heat so it is just barely simmering. While milk mixture cooks, drain the rice, rinse it and set aside. Fill the medium pot halfway with fresh water and bring to a boil. Add drained rice to the boiling water, turn down heat, and simmer 6 min. Drain rice again. Add drained rice to the milk mixture and continue to cook at a gentle simmer, stirring occasionally, until the mixture has thickened considerably, another 20-25 min. Let cool slightly, then remove cinnamon sticks and vanilla bean. Serve warm, room temp, or cold. sprinkle with ground cinnamon to taste.
