  --Cook's Country

3 tbsp extra-virgin olive oil, divided
1 small onion, chopped fine
4 garlic cloves, minced, divided
12 oz (3 3/4 c) penne
28 oz can crushed tomatoes
3 c water
2 tsp table salt, divided
1/2 tsp red pepper flakes
1/2 c panko bread crumbs
2 1/2 lb rotisserie chicken, skin and bones discarded, meat shredded into bite-size pieces (3 c)
8 oz whole-milk mozzarella cheese, shredded (2 c)

Heat 2 tbsp oil in Dutch oven over medium heat until shimmering. Add onion and 3/4 of garlic and cook until softened, ~4 min. Add pasta, tomatoes, water, 1 3/4 tsp salt, and pepper flakes and bring to boil. Reduce heat to medium; cover; and simmer until pasta is tender, ~10 min, stirring occasionally. Meanwhile, combine panko, remaining 1 tbsp oil, remaining garlic, and remaining 1/4 tsp salt in bowl. Microwave until golden brown, 2-3 min, stirring occasionally; set aside. Adjust oven rack to middle position and heat broiler. Stir chicken into pasta and sprinkle mozzarella over top. Broil until mozzarella is melted and spotty brown, ~5 min. Sprinkle with reserved panko mixture. Serve.
