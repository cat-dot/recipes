Creamy Parmesan Polenta
  --America's Test Kitchen

7 1/2 c water
1 1/2 tsp salt
pinch baking soda
1 1/2 c coars ground cornmeal
2 tbsp unsalted butter
4 oz parmesan cheese, grated (~2 c) + extra for serving
ground black pepper

Bring water to boil in heavy bottomed 4 quart saucepan over medium high heat. Stir in salt and baking soda. Slowly pour cornmeal into water in steady stream, while stirring back and forth with wooden spoon or rubber spatula. Bring mixture to boil, stirring constantly, ~1 min. Reduce heat to lowest possible setting and cover. After 5 min, whisk polenta to smooth out any lumps that may have formed, ~15 s. Make sure to scrape down sides and bottom of pan. Cover and continue to cook, without stirring, until grains of polenta are tender but slightly al dente, ~25 min. Polenta should be loose and barely hold its shape but will continue to thicken as it cools. Remove from heat, stir in butter and paremsan, and season to taste with black pepper. Let stand, covered, 5 min. Serve, passing paremsan separately.


Notes: Use coarse ground degerminated cornmeal such as yellow grits. Avoid instant or quick cooking products, whole grain, stone ground, and regular corn meal.
