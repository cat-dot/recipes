4 large eggs, separated
1/2 tsp cream of tartar
55g cream cheese (can use lactose free)
1.2 tso sea salt
1 tsp herbs of your choice (optional)
1/4 tsp garlic powder (optional)

Heat oven to 150C/300F. Line 2 baking sheets with parchment paper. Separate the whites from the yolks and place in separate bowls. Add cream cheese to the yolks, beat with an electric or stand mixer until fully blended. Beat in the salt and seasonings (if using). Using separate whisk attachment (or clean in between), whip the whites. Add the cream of tartar and beat on high until firm peaks form. Gently fold whites into the yolk mixture, trying to not deflate as you do. Spoon onto baking sheets in 1/4 c portions, making 4" circles and leaving space around each. Bake for 30 min or until golden on the outside and firm. Cool on baking sheets for several minutes before removing.

Notes: Can be stored in airtight container in the fridge for several days. Can play with different herbs, or go heavy on garlic (won't be low FODMAP then).
