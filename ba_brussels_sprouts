Brussels Sprouts with Pistachios and Lime
  --Christina Chaey and Claire Saffitz
  
2 lb small brussels sprouts
3 tbsp vegetable oil
kosher salt and freshly ground pepper
3 tbsp unsalted butter
3 tbsp raw pistachios
2 tbsp date molasses or honey
1 tsp honey
zest of 1/2 lime
2 tbsp fresh lime juice
1/2 tsp crushed red pepper flakes
lime wedges for serving (optional)

Place a rack in lower third of oven; preheat to 450F. Toss sprouts and oil in large bowl to coat; season with salt and pepper. Roast on a rimmed baking sheet 15 min, then shake baking sheet to loosen them. Continue to roast until deeply browned all over, 5-10 min longer. Reduce oven temp to 350F and roast another 10 min. Shake baking sheet again, then roast until the tip of a small knife easily slides through, 5-10 min longer; total cook time will be 35-45 min. Melt butter in large skillet over medium heat. Once butter starts to foam, add pistachios and a pinch of salt and cook, stirring often, until nuts are golden brown and butter solids are browned, ~4 min. Remove from heat. Using slotted spoon, transfer nuts to paper towels; let cool. Coarsely chop. Bring date molasses, honey, and lime juice to a simmer in now empty skillet over medium heat, swirling pan to emulsify. Add 1 tbsp water and swirl to emulsify, scraping up fond with a wooden spoon. Add brussels ; toss to coat. Transfer to a platter. Toss nuts, zest, red pepper flakes, and a pinch of salt in a small bowl to combine; scatter over sprouts. Serve with lime wedges if desired. 


Notes: Sprouts, glaze (without water), and nut mixture can all be made 3 hrs ahead. Do not combine. Reheat glaze over medium heat until bubbling before adding water and brussels sprouts.
