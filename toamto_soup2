500ml vegetable or chicken stock
2 celery sticks, halved
1 carrot, halved
1 small onion
1 garlic clove
1⁄2 tbsp olive oil
500g mixed tomatoes, such as beef, plum and cherry , roughly chopped
1 x 400g can plum tomatoes
1 tbsp red wine vinegar
salt and pepper

￼￼￼In a small saucepan, bring the stock to the boil. Place the celery, carrot, onion and garlic into a hand-held mini blender and blitz until roughly chopped. Transfer to a medium saucepan, with the olive oil and 1 tablespoon of water and sauté for a couple of minutes. Add the chopped tomatoes and cook for 2–3 min. longer, followed by the tinned tomatoes and stock. Simmer for 10 min. Add the vinegarr, blitz until smooth and season to taste with salt and pepper.

Notes:As the calorie content of this soup is so low, you can afford to be a little indulgent. Make a cream of tomato soup by adding 75ml cream once the soup has been blitzed. The soup will then be 105 calories per portion, but won’t be dairy free. You can also add a bunch of basil before blending to create a basil and tomato soup.
