Sourdough Starter
  --America's Test Kitchen

4 1/2 c (24 3/4 oz) whole wheat flour
5 c (25 oz) ap flour + more for maintaining starter
room temp water

Combine flours in large container. Using wooden spoon, mix 1 c (5 oz) flour mixture and 2/3 c (5 1/3 oz) water in glass bowl until no dry flour remains; reserve remaining flour mixture. Cover with plastic wrap and let sit at room temp until bubbly and fragrant, 48-72 hr. 
Feed starter: Measure out 1/4 c (2 oz) start and transfer to clean bowl or jar; discard remaining starter. Stir in 1/2 c (2 1/2 oz) reserved flour mixture and 1/4 c (2 oz) water into starter until no dry flour remains. Cover with plastic wrap and let sit at room temp for 24 hrs. Repeat feeding starter every 24 hr until starter is pleasantly aromatic and doubles in size 8-12 hr after being fed, 10-14 days. At this point starter is mature and ready to be baked with, or can be moved to storage. If baking, use starter once it has doubled in size during 8-12 hr window. Use starter within 1 hr after it starts to deflate once reaching its peak.
Maintenance: Measure out 1/4 c (2 oz) starter and transfer to clean bowl; discard remaining starter. Stir 1/2 c (2 1/2 oz) ap flour and 1/4 c (2 oz) water into starter until no dry flour remains. Transfer to clean container that can be loosely covered and let sit at room temp for 5 hr. Cover and transfer to refrigerator. If not baking, repeat process weekly.
Prep for baking: 18-24 hr before baking, measure out 1/2 c (4 oz) starter and transfer to clean bowl; discard remaining starter. Stir in 1 c (5 oz) ap flour and 1/2 c (4 oz) room temp water into starter until no dry flour remains. Cover and let sit at room temp for 5 hr. Measure out amount of starter called for in recipe and transfer to second bowl. Cover and refrigerate for at least 12 hr or up to 18 hr. Remaining starter should be refrigerated and maintained as directed.



Notes: It's ok to occasionally miss a daily feeding, but don't let it go for more than 48 hr.
