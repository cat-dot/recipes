1 tbsp baking powder
1 tsp kosher salt + more 1/4 tsp ground coriander

8 large dill pickles, sliced 1/4" thick

In a medium bowl, whisk together the flour, baking powder, salt, coriander, and cayenne. Mix in the egg followed by the beer to form a smooth batter. In a 4 quart dutch oven, heat 2" of vegetable oil to 375F and line a plate with paper towels. Working in batches, dip the pickle slices into the batter, then slowly drop into the oil. Cook until golden brown, 2-3 min. Using a slotted spoon, transfer the pickle to the prepared plate to drain. Immediately season with salt.
