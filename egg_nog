Egg Nog
  --Cook's Illustrated

6 large eggs
2 yolks
1/2 c +2 tbsp sugar
1/4 tsp salt
4 c whole milk
1/2 c brandy, bourbon, or dark rum
1 tbsp vanilla
1/2 tsp fresh grated nutmeg + extra for garnish
1/2 c heavy cream, whipped to soft peaks

Off heat, whisk eggs, yolks, sugar, and salt in heavy 3-4 qt saucpan. Stir in milk, one 1/2 c at a time, blending well after each addition. Heat slowly over lowest possible flame, stirring constantly, until custard registers 160F, thickens, and coats back of a spoon, 25-30 min. Pour custard through sieve into large bowl; stir in liquor, vanilla, and nutmeg. Cover with plastic wrap and refrigerate until well chilled, at least 3 hrs and up to 3 days. Just before serving, whip cream in medium bowl to very soft peaks and gently fold into custard mixture until incorporated. Serve in chilled glasses, garnishing with nutmeg (optional)
