Dunderi with Lemon and Butter

480g (2c) whole-milk ricotta cheese
6 egg yolks
45g (1c) finely grated parmesan cheese, using a microplane
pinch freshly grated nutmeg
1 tsp kosher salt
160g (1c) + 2 tbsp ap flour, plus more for dusting
semolina flour for dusting

In a large bowl, mix the ricotta and egg yolks until smooth. Stir in the parmesan, nutmeg, salt, and flour until the dough just comes together. Dust a work surface with 1/4c flour. Scrape the dough onto the work surface and sprinkle with an additional 1/4c of flour to prevent the dough from sticking. Line a rimmed baking sheet with parchment paper and dust with semolina flour. Using a pastry cutter, divide the dough into 6 equal portions. With floured hands, roll each piece into a log about 1/2" in diameter. Cut the log into 1/2-1" long pieces. Place the dunderi on the prepared baking sheet, continue until all dough has been cut up. Make sure the dunderi pieces are not touching so they don't stick together. These can be made ahead, covered and chilled for up to 2 days, or frozen for up to 1 month.
To cook: bring a large pot of salted water to a simmer over medium high heat. Add the dunderi and simmer until they begin to float to the surface, 45 sec to 2 min.

Sauce

1 stick unsalted butter
2 tsp fresh lemon juice
zest of 1 lemon
kosher salt to taste

In a large skillet over medium heat, melt the butter until the butter becomes golden brown and turns toasty, 6-8 min. Add the lemon juice and zest, and season with salt. Add the dumplings and toss to coat. Top with parm and serve.
