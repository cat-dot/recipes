Sriracha Mac and Cheese

1 lb ritoni pasta
1 1/2 tbsp unsalted butter
2 tbsp arrowroot
1/2 c red onion, diced
1 1/2 c low sodium chicken stock
1 c 2% milk
1 heaping c fontiago cheese, shredded (can sub fontina, gouda, or white cheddar)
2 tsp sriracha (add more for more heat)
salt and pepper to taste

Bring a pot of water to boil. In a small saucepan over medium heat melt butter. Whisk in arrowroot, continually stirring the entire time. Add onions, cook for 2-3 min until translucent. Whisk in chicken broth, milk, and sriracha; continue to whisk until lumps are gone. Raise to medium high heat and cook for 10-12 min, whisking occasionally. Sauce will start to thicken. Meanwhile, add pasta to boiling water and cook until al dente (per package). Drain and place in a large bowl. Remove milk mixture from heat, add in cheese, salt, and pepper. Whisk until cheese is melted. Pour cheese mixture over the pasta, toss to combine. Garnish with cracked pepper and/or fresh basil.
