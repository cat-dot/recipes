Hasselback Zucchini

Bread Crumbs:
2 tbsp olive oil
1/2 c finely ground bread crumbs
1 tbsp parsley, roughly chopped
1 tsp oregano, roughly chopped
1 tsp thyme, roughly chopped
kosher salt to taste

In a 10" skilet, heat the oil over medium high heat. Add the bread crumbs and the herbs, and season with salt to taste. Toast until golden brown, stirring constantly to make sure they don't burn, 8-9 min. Keep warm until needed.

Compound Butte:
1/2 c unsalted butter, softened
1/4 c finely grated parmesan cheese
1/2 tbsp lemon zest
1/2 tsp onion powder
1/2 tsp garlic powder
kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper to taste

In a medium bowl, add all the ingredients and mix until fully incorporated. Set aside.

Zucchini:
4 medium zucchini
compound butter
toasted bread crumbs
finely grated parmesan for garnish
roughly chopped parsley, oregano, and thyme for garnish
lemon wedges for serving

Preheat oven to 350F. Slice each zucchini in 1/4" thick slices, without cutting all the way through to keep it in one piece. Place on a baking sheet and roast in oven for 10 min. Remove and add dabs of butter between each slice. Place back in oven and roast for 10 min more, basting with the melted butter in the pan halfway through. Transfer to a serving patter to assemble. Top with the bread crumbs and garnish with grated parmesan, chopped herbs. Squeeze a lemon wedge over each and serve.
