  --Cook's Country

2 c blackberries
2/3 c sugar, divided
1/2 tsp grated lemon zest
3 c ap flour
1 tbsp baking powder
1 tsp salt
16 tbsp (2 sticks) unsalted butter, cut into 1/2" pieces and chilled
1 c milk, whole or low fat

Cook berries and 1/4 c sugar in saucepan over medium low heat until berries begin to release juice, ~3 min. Increase heat to medium high and cook, stirring frequently, until berries break down and mixture is thick and jam like, ~10 min. Mixture should measure 1/2 c. Transfer to bowl, stir in zest, and cool to room temp. Pulse flour, baking powder, salt, 1/2 c sugar, and all but 1 tbsp butter in food processor until mixture resembles coarse meal. Transfer to large bowl and stir in milk until combined. Adjust oven rack to middle position and heat oven to 375F. Line baking sheet with parchment paper. Turn dough onto lightly floured surface and knead until smooth, 8-10 times. Pat dough into 6" square, wrap with plastic, and freeze until just firm, ~20 min. Roll dough into 12x10" rectangle, spread with jam leaving a 1/2" border, roll into tight cylinder strating with the long edge, and arrange seam side down on prepared baking sheet. Melt remaining butter and brush over dough. Sprinkle with remaining sugar and bake until golden brown, ~45 min. Let cool 10 min on sheet, then transfer to wire rack. Serve warm or at room temp. Can be made ahead, wrap unbaked roly poly in plastic and refrigerate on baking sheet up to 24 hrs. Baking time will be 50 min for chilled.


Notes: Can use fresh or frozen berries
