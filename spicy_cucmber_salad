Sweet and Spicy Cucumber Salad
  --Yia Vang

1/2 bunch cilantro
1 small shallot, finely chopped
1 garlic clove, finely grated
2 Thai chiles, finely chopped
1/4 c tamarind concentrate
2 tbsp. fresh lime juice
2 tsp. fish sauce
6 medium Persian cucumbers or 1 large English hothouse cucumber, some peel removed in thin alternating strips, halved lengthwise, thinly sliced on a diagonal
1 c cherry tomatoes, halved
Kosher salt
Store-bought fried shallots and coarsely chopped salted dry-roasted peanuts (for serving)

Thinly slice cilantro stems until you have ~2 tbsp. and place in a large bowl. Coarsely chop remaining cilantro; set aside for serving. Add shallot, garlic, chiles, tamarind concentrate, lime juice, and fish sauce to bowl with cilantro stems and mix well. Add cucumbers and tomatoes, season with salt, and toss until everything is nicely dressed. Transfer salad to a platter and top with reserved chopped cilantro, then fried shallots and peanuts.


Notes: Tamarind concentrate, often labeled “concentrate cooking tamarind”
