Apple Crumble
  --Cook's Illustrated

4 lbs golden delicious apples, peeled, cored, and cut into 3/4" pieces
2 tbsp packed + 1/2 c packed (3 1/2 oz) dark brown sugar, divided
2 tbsp lemon juice
1 tsp talbe salt, divided
3/4 tsp ground cinnamon
1 c (5 oz) ap flour
1/2 c sliced almonds, chopped fine
6 tbsp unsalted butter, melted
2 tsp vanilla 
2 tsp water

Adjust over racks to upper middle and lowest positions and heat oven to 400F. Toss apples, 2 tbsp sugar, lemon juice, 1/2 tsp salt, and cinnamon together in large bowl. Transfer to 8" square baking pan with at least 2" sides and press into even layer. Cover tightly with foil and place on rimmed baking sheet. Transfer sheet to oven and bake on lower rack for 35 min. While apples bake, whisk flour, almonds, remaining sugar, and remaining salt in medium bowl until combined. Add butter, vanilla, and water and stir with spatula until clumps form and no dry flour remains. Remove sheet from oven and smooth top of apples with spatula. If apples have not collapsed enough to leave at least 1/4" of space below rim of pan, replace foil, return sheet to oven, and continue to bake 5-15 min longer. Scatter topping evenly over apples, braking up any clumps larger than a marble. Transfer sheet to upper rack and bake until topping is evenly browned and filling is just bubbling at edges, 25-35 min. Transfer pan to wire rack and let cool for at least 45 min before serving.


Notes: Can use braeburn, honeycrisp, or a combo of the 3 types. Light brown sugar will work if you don't have dark. don't use glass baking dish.
