Fettucini Alfredo with Avocados

4 medium avocados, halved, pitted, and peeled
¼ c Parmesan cheese, grated, plus more for garnish
¼ c lemon juice
1 tsp lemon zest
1 tsp onion powder
½ tsp freshly ground black pepper
½ tsp garlic powder
Kosher salt, to taste
1 lb dry fettuccine
2 c reserved pasta cooking liquid
6 tbsp pine nuts, toasted, divided
3 tbsp parsley leaves, roughly chopped, divided
Small parsley leaves, for garnish

Bring 4 quart pot of water to a boil. In the base of a food processor, add the avocados, cheese, lemon juice and zest, onion powder, pepper, and garlic powder. Purée the mixture until smooth and season lightly with salt. Transfer the sauce to a large bowl. Once the water comes to a boil, salt the water and add the fettuccine. Cook the pasta to a desired doneness, 7-10 min. Drain the pasta, reserving 2 c of the cooking liquid. Add the cooked pasta to the large bowl and toss the pasta in with the dressing. The mixture will be thick. Use the cooking liquid to get the sauce to a creamy consistency. Toss in 4 tbsp of pine nuts and 2 tbsp of chopped parsley, and season with salt to taste. Garnish with remaining pine nuts, parsley, and whole parsley leaves.
