Sweet Potato Muffins

1 c mashed sweet potato (~2 small)
1/4 c  ghee (or coconut oil)
1  egg
1/2 maple syrup
1/2 c almond milk
1 tbsp chia seeds
1 tsp vanilla
1 c old fashioned oats
1 c  oat flour (or 1 1/3 c of oats ground in the vitamix or food processor)
1 1/2 tsp baking powder
1 tsp baking soda
1 tsp cinnamon
1/2 tsp nutmeg
1/2 tsp cloves
1/8 tsp sea salt
1/2 c raw walnuts, coarsely chopped

Preheat oven to 400F. Line a muffin tin with paper muffin cups. Cut two small, orange-fleshed sweet potatoes in half lengthwise and bake until soft, ~30 min. Scoop out the insides and discard the skin. Place in a blender and blend with the ghee. In a medium bowl, beat the egg lightly. Add maple syrup, whisk until combined. Add almond milk, sweet potato mixture, chia seeds and vanilla, whisk until combined. In a large bowl, mix all dry ingredients together except for the walnuts. Add wet ingredients to dry ingredients, stir in walnuts. Distribute batter evenly between muffin cups. Bake 20-25 min or until a toothpick inserted in the middle comes out clean.
