Herb Roasted Chicken

Brine:
8 c water, divided
1/2 c kosher salt
1/4 c honey
1/4 c sugar
1 tbsp whole black peppercorns
3 thyme sprigs
2 bay leaves
2 garlic cloves
1 yellow onion, quartered
1 lemon, halved
3-4lb chicken

In a large pot, combine 2 c water with the salt, honey, sugar, peppercorns, thyme, bay leaves, garlic, onion, and lemon. Bring to a boil and cook until the salt and sugar dissolve, 2-3 min. Remove from the heat and add the remaining 6 c water. Let cool completely, then add the chicken, submerging entirely. Refrigerate overnight.

Chicken:
4 tbsp unsalted butter, softened
1 tbsp salt
2 tsp thyme leaves
1 tsp freshly ground black pepper
1 tsp lemon zest
1 garlic clove, grated

Preheat oven to 400F. In a medium bowl, mix the butter, salt, thyme, pepper, lemon zest, and garlic until smooth, set aside. Remove chicken from the brine and pat dry with paper towels. Transfer the chicken to a roasting pan. Rub the chicken completely with the butter mixture, lifting the skin off the breasts to caot underneath. Roast, basting every 15 min, until the chicken is golden brown and reachees an internal temp of 165F, 55-60 min. Let rest for 10 min then carve.
