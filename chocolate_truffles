  --America's Test Kitchen

Ganache:
2 c (12 oz) bittersweet chocolate, roughly chopped
1/2 c heavy cream
2 tbsp light corn syrup
1/2 tsp vanilla
pinch salt
1 1/2 tbsp unsalted butter, cut into 8 pieces and softened

Lightly coat 8" baking dish with vegetable oil spray. Make parchment sling, pushing parchment into corners and up sides of pan, smoothing flush to pan. Microwave chocolate in medium bowl at 50% power, stirring occasionally, until mostly melted and few small chocolate pieces remain, 2-3 min; set aside. Microwave cream in measuring cup until warm to touch, ~30 s. Stir corn syrup, vanilla, and salt into cream and pour mixture over chocoalte. Cover bowl with plastic wrap, set aside for 3 min, and then stir with wooden spoon to combine. Stir in butter, one piece at a time, until fully incorporated. Using rubber spatula, transfer ganache to prepared pan and set aside at room temp for 2 hr. Cover pan and transfer to refrigerator; chill for at least 2 hr. Ganache can be stored, refrigerated for up to 2 days. 

Coating:
1 c (3 oz) dutch process cocoa
1/4 c (1 oz) confectioners' sugar

Sift cocoa and sugar into large bowl. Sift again into large cake pan and set aside. Using sling, lift ganache from pan. Cut ganache into 64 1" squares, if ganache cracks during slicing, let sit at room temp for 5-10 min and then proceed. Dust hands lightly with cocoa mixture to prevent sticking and roll each square into ball. Transfer balls to cake pan and roll to evenly coat. Lightly shake truffles in hand over pan to remove excess. Transfer coated truffles to airtight container and repeat until all ganache is rolled up and coated. Cover container and refrigerate for at least 2 hr or up to 1 week. Let truffles sit at room temp for 5-10 min before serving.


Notes: truffles can be flavored with 2 tbsp of favorite liqueur
