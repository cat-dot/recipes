BBQ Pulled Pork
  --Breville (via Sur la Table)

Spice Rub:
2 tbsp sea salt
2 tbsp brown sugar
1 tbsp paprika
1 tsp freshly ground black pepper
1 tsp crushed chili flakes
1/2 tsp dry mustard
1/4 tsp cayenne pepper

Combine spice rub ingredients in a small bowl.

Pork:
2.6 kg boneless pork shoulder, skin removed
1 large brown onion, thinly sliced
4 garlic cloves, peeled and crushed
1 1/4 c (300ml) apple cider vinegar
1/4 c (60ml) Worcestershire sauce
1/2 c (125ml) water

Coat the pork with the spice mixture and place in a large bowl. Cover and refrigerate overnight. Place onion and garlic in a large (5.5 qt/6 l) Dutch oven. Place pork on top of onion and garlic. Pour over any juices that may have accumulated in the bowl. Add the cider vinegar, Worcestershire sauce and water to a medium bowl, stir to combine. Pour the mixture over the pork. Cover the Dutch oven with a double layer of tight fitting aluminum foil. Cook the pork on high for 6-8 hr (slow cook/convection) or on low for 8-10 hr. Remove pork to a bowl and shred with two forks. Skim fat off cooking liquid and return pork to Dutch oven.

BBQ Sauce:
2/3 c (150ml) cider vinegar
2 c (500ml) tomato passata (puree)
1/2 c (180ml) treacle
1/3 c (85ml) Worcestershire sauce
1/2 c (80g) brown sugar
2 tsp smoked paprika
1 garlic clove, crushed
2 tbsp mustard

Add vinegar, passata, treacle, Worcestershire sauce, sugar, paprika, garlic and mustard in a medium saucepan. Cook on medium heat, stirring, for 10 min or until smooth and combined. Reduce heat to low and simmer, stirring occasionally, for 40 min or until sauce has thickened and turned to a maroon color. Season. Cool completely.


Notes: this is apparently assuming you're using a Breville; no temps given for cooking in original recipe
