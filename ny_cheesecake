New York Style Cheesecake with Raspberry Swirl

Crust:
1 1/2 c graham cracker crumbs
6 tbsp unsalted butter, melted
1/2 tsp cinnamon
1/2 tsp kosher salt

Preheat oven to 350F.  In a medium bowl, mix all the ingredients until incorporated and press into a 9" springform pan. Spread the crumbs evenly along the bottom and 1" up the sides of the pan. Bake until golden, 15 min. Let cool completely.

Raspberry Swirl:
1 1/2 c (6oz) raspberries
1/4 c sugar
1 tbsp lemon juice
2 tsp lemon zest
1 tsp cornstarch

In a medium saucepan, combine all the ingredients over medium heat. Cook until the raspberries have broekn down and the mixture has thickened, 10 min. Transfer to a blender and puree until smooth, then strain.

32 oz full fat cream cheese at room temp
1 1/2 c sugar
1/2 c sour cream
1 tsp lemon zest
1/2 tsp salt
1 vanilla been, seeds scraped
4 room temp eggs
boiling water for baking

In a stand mixer fitted with the paddle attachment, combine the cream cheese, sugar, sour cream, lemon zest, salt, and vanilla seeds. Beat on medium speed until smooth. With the motor running, add the eggs 1 at a time, scraping the sides of the bowl after each addition. Wrap the bottom of the springform pan with 2 large sheets of foil and place in a roasting pan. Pour the cream cheese mixture over the crust. Spoon the raspberry puree over the top and, using a knice, swirl it into the batter. Pour boiling water into the roasting rack halfway up the pan and bake until set, 1 hr 45 min. After 1 hr, cover the cake loosely in foil for the remainder of the cook time. Remove from the water bath and let cool completely. Refrigerate overnight before serving.
