Goldfish Crackers

2 c ap flour
8 tbsp (1 stick) cold butter
1 lb grated sharp cheddar
2 tsp baking powder
1 1/2 tsp kosher salt

In a food processor, pulse all the ingredients until a dough forms. Separate the dough into 3 balls. Press down on each ball to form a 1" thick disk. Wrap the dough in plastic wrap & chill for 1 hr. Preheat oven to 325F. Using a rolling pin, roll each disk out to 1/8" thick. Use a goldfish shapped cutter to cut out the crackers and place them on a parchment-lined baking sheet. Reroll & cut the remnants. Bake for 15-20min or until the goldfish begin to crack around the edges. Remove an let cool for 30 min before eating.
