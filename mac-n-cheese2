Mac and Cheese
  --Brandon Fletcher

32 oz grated cheddar cheese
16 oz grated gruyere cheese
9 oz grated parmesan cheese
16 oz elbow macaroni
2 tbsp butter
2 tbsp flour
3 c milk
1 tsp thyme
1 tsp paprika
1 tsp cayenne pepper
1 tsp garlic powder
1 tsp mustard powder
1 tsp black pepper
1 tbsp spicy brown mustard
1/2 tsp nutmeg
1/2 c sour cream
2 eggs
1 c panko bread crumbs

Fill stock pot with water, salt heavily and bring to a boil. Once boiling, cook macaroni just slightly longer than package recommendation for al dente. Preheat oven to 400F. Set saucepan to medium high heat and add the butter. Once it is melted, add the flour and stir constantly until the paste is lightly browned. Once browned, pour in the milk and stir until nice and thick. Stir in half of the cheddar, then all the gruyere, and half the parmesan. Stir until cheese is completely melted and fully incorporated. Add the seasoning. Beat one egg in a bowl, and then add to the sauce, along with sour cream. Stir to combine. Add the cooked & drained pasta to the sauce and stir everything one last time to combine, then turn off heat. Crease a 10x15" baking dish, then layer in ~1/3 of the mixture. Then take ~1/2 the reserved cheddar and add a layer on top of the macaroni. Add another layer of macaroni on top of that, then the rest of the cheddar, and finally the rest of the macaroni. In a bowl, beat one egg with 2 c milk, and evenly pour over the mac and cheese. Add a layer of breadcrumbs and the remaining parmesan on top. If you're feeling fancy, can melt some butter and toss breadcrumbs in that and toast until golden brown before putting on top. Place in oven and bake for 20-30 min, until the top is evenly browned and it's nice and bubbly.
