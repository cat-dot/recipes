Garlicy Broiled Shrimp
  --America's Test Kitchen

1 1/2 lb extra-large shrimp, (21-25 per lb), peeled and deveined, tails left on
1/2 tsp kosher salt
4 tbsp unsalted butter
1 tbsp honey
6 garlic cloves, minced to paste
1/2-3/4 tsp red pepper flakes

Toss shrimp and salt together in bowl; set aside and let sit for 15-30 min. Combine butter and honey in small bowl. Cover and microwave until butter is melted, 30-60 s. Add garlic and pepper flakes and stir to combine. Let cool slightly, ~5 min. While mixture cools, adjust oven rack 4" from broiler element and heat broiler. Line rimmed baking sheet with aluminum foil and set wire rack in sheet. Spread out shrimp on large plate or cutting board and pat dry with paper towels. Return to bowl and pour butter mixture over shrimp. Toss until shrimp are thoroughly and evenly coated, including where they are split from deveining (it's OK if butter starts to solidify). Arrange shrimp in single layer on prepared rack. Broil until shrimp are opaque throughout and beginning to lightly char in spots, 3-5 min. Transfer shrimp to serving platter and serve, passing lemon wedges separately.


Notes: prefer untreated shrimp; if shrimp are treated with salt or additives such as sodium tripolyphosphate, skip the salting. This recipe was developed with Diamond Crystal kosher salt. If you're using Morton, which is denser, use a little less than 1/2 tsp. A rasp-style grater makes quick work of turning the garlic into a paste. For a simpler flavor profile suitable for serving with cocktail sauce or adding to salad or pasta, omit the garlic and red pepper flakes.
