1 c butter + extra for pan
1 3/4 c 68% Tcho chocolate discs
1 1/2 c + 1 tbsp organic sugar
9 eggs
1 1/2 tsp espresso
2 tsp vanilla
1 tsp salt
1 3/4 c pastry flour
1 c ap (type 70) flour

Preheat oven to 300F or 325F. Butter baking  8x12x2 pan on all sides and bottom. Cut parchment paper to fit the bottom of the pan and the sides, extending over the sides to prevent spillage. Butter the parchment paper. In a heatproof bowl, over a suace pot of boiling water, melt the following ingredients: butter, chocolate, espresso, salt, and vanilla. Set aside to cool. In a stand mixer, whisk together eggs and sugar until it is all incorporated. Add 1/2 the egg mixture to the melted chocolate and slightly whisk in. Immediately place the remaining egg mixture over the sauce pot of boiling water to slightly warm to the touch. Once warmed, using whisk attachment, mix on speed 3-4 for exactly 5 min. It will get very light and fluffy when finished. Pour into the chocolate mixture & gently fold in with a spatula until 90% mixed. Sift the flour straight into chocolate in 3 additions. Fold flour in after each addition. Once finished, pour batter into lined baking pan & bake at 300 with convection or 325 for non for 25 min, rotating pan half way through (~12 min). Let cool to room temp and then refrigerate for at least 3 hrs until chilled and sliceable. Serve at room temp & keep leftovers refrigerated.
