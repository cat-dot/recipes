Lemon Thyme Bars

Crust:
1 c ap flour
¼ c almond flour
¼ c sugar
2 tbsp cold water
1 tsp lemon zest
1 tsp thyme leaves
1 tsp kosher salt
10 tbsp unsalted butter, cubed and chilled

Preheat the oven to 325F and line a 9-inch square pan with parchment paper so it hangs over the edges of the pan. In a food processor, add all the crust ingredients and pulse until a crumbly dough forms. Press the dough into the prepared pan, covering the entire surface. Bake until golden, 30 min.

Curd:
1½ c sugar
¾ c freshly squeezed lemon juice
2 tsp lemon zest
1½ tsp cornstarch
½ tsp kosher salt
2 eggs, plus 3 yolks
4 thyme sprigs
4 tbsp unsalted butter
2 tbsp olive oil

 In a small saucepan, whisk together the sugar, lemon juice and zest, cornstarch, salt, eggs and egg yolks until smooth. Add the thyme sprigs and place over medium heat. Cook, stirring constantly, until thickened, 8-10 min. Remove from the heat and strain, then stir in the butter and olive oil until smooth.
 
 Immediately after removing the crust from the oven, pour the curd over the crust, spreading evenly with an offset spatula. Return to the oven and bake until set, 10-15 min.  Let cool completely, then refrigerate for 30 min. Remove the bars from the pan, using the overhanging parchment. Dust with confectioners' sugar and garnish with thyme leaves, then cut into 12 bars and serve.
