Eggplant Bacon
  --Sarah Bond

1 medium eggplant
2 Tbsp shoyu (30 mL), or tamari for GF option
1 Tbsp toasted sesame oil 15 mL
1 Tbsp olive oil (15 mL)
1 tsp maple syrup (5 mL)
1 tsp lemon juice (5 mL)
1 tsp smoked paprika
1/2 tsp each salt, black pepper, and cumin
1/4 tsp vegan Worcestershire sauce

Preheat air fryer or oven to 300F (150 C). Cut eggplant into quarters lengthwise, then thinly slice into long strips resembling bacon (~1/8" thick, a mandolin slicer makes this easier). In a small bowl, stir to combine all remaining ingredients. Liberally brush onto both sides of eggplant slices. If air frying, place bacon in a single layer in your air frying pan and cook for 10-15 min, until dry and browned. If baking, place on a parchment-lined baking sheet in a single layer and bake for 30-40 min, until dry and browned.
