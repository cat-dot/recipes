Candied Orange Shortbread

Peel:
1 orange
water
1 c granulated sugar

Use a vegetable peeler to remove the skin from the orange, making sure that no pith remains on the peel. In a small saucepot, bring 1 c water to a boil. Add the peels and cook for 1 min. Drain and rinse the peels under cold water. Repeat this process 3 more times with fresh water. Combine the granulated sugar and 1 c fresh water and bring to a simmer. Once the sugar has dissolved, add the orange peel and simmer until the peel is tender and transparent, ~10 min. Remove the orange peel from the liquid and set aside to cool on a baking rack lined with parchment paper. Once the peel is cool, finely chop and reserve.

Shortbread:
2 c ap flour
1/2 tsp baking powder
1/2 tsp flaky sea salt
2 sticks unsalted butter, melted and cooled to room temp
1 c confectioners' sugar
1 vanilla bean, split and scraped

Butter and flour a 4x14" tart pan or an 8" round tart pan with a removable bottom. Line the pan with parchment paper, leaving an overhang on 2 opposite sides. Butter and flour the parchment paper. In a medium bowl, whisk together the flour, baking powder, salt, and reserved candied orange peel. In another medium bowl, whisk together the butter, powdered sugar, vanilla bean seeds, and a pinch of salt. Fold the flour mixture into the butter and mix until just incorporated. Spread the dough into the prepared pan, cover with plastic wrap and refrigerated for min 2 hrs. Preheat the oven to 325F. Remove the shortbread from the refrigerator and place in the oven. Bake until golden and set ~45 min to 1 hr. Let the shortbread cool slightly before removing it from the pan. Cut into triangular pieces. Serve immediately or store in an airtight container for up to 3 days.
