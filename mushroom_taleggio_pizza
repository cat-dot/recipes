Â¼ c evoo, divided
12 oz mixed mushrooms, sliced 1/4" thick
3 garlic cloves, minced
1 1/2 tsp minced fresh rosemary

1/4 tsp table salt
1 lb pizza dough, room temperature
6 oz (3/4 c) small-curd cottage cheese

1 oz Parmesan cheese, grated (1/2 c)

Transfer dough to prepared sheet. Spread cottage cheese evenly over top. Sprinkle with fontina and mushrooms. Sprinkle with Taleggio, followed by Parmesan. Bake until cheese is spotty brown and crust is golden, 13-15 min, rotating sheet halfway through baking. Transfer pizza to wire rack and let cool for 5 min. Slice and serve.
