Kari Ayam - low FODMAP, gf
  --Jessica Kellgren-Fozard

Spice Paste:
1 bunch spring onions, green tops only
6 fresh red chillies, seeds removed (unless you like heat)
8 mac nuts (or candlenuts if you have em)
2" ginger
2 shoots lemongrass, roughly chopped
20g belachan

Combine all ingredients in a food processor and blend to a paste. Cover and leave to mature overnight.

Curry:
1.5kg chicken, bony parts (thigh, legs, wings)
600ml chicken stock
1 can (400ml) coconut milk
1 cinnamon stick
2 pieces star anise
4 pieces cloves
6 pieces green cardamom
6 curry leaves
1 tbsp fish sauce
1 tsp brown sugar replacement (surkin)
3 tbsp garlic flavord oil (can use garlic if not doing low FODMAP)

In a large bowl, combine the spice paste and chcken, making sure to cover every last inch, then cover and marinate for 30 min. Heat the garlic oil in a large wok and saute the cinnamon, star anise, cloves, cardamom, and curry leaves. Add the chicken and any remaining spice paste and fry on low heat. Pour in the stock and bring to a boil. Lower the heat, cover the wok, then simmer for 40 min. Add coconut milk, cover and simmer for 20 min more. Season with fish sauce and brown sugar. 

If making with pasta, cook pasta to package instructions. Portion out a serving and cover with Kari, garnishing with sliced spring onions and watercress. Or just serve with rice.
