  -Hummusapien

Cookies:
½ c almond flour
½ c coconut flour
⅓ c coconut sugar
¼ c chia seeds
1 tsp baking powder
¾ tsp baking soda
¼ tsp salt
½ c overripe mashed banana (1 large banana)
1 c plain yogurt of choice
¼ c lemon juice
1 tbsp lemon zest
1 tsp vanilla 

Preheat oven to 350F. Line a large baking sheet with parchment paper or silpat (or spray with cooking spray). In a medium mixing bowl, stir together almond flour, coconut flour, coconut sugar, chia seeds, baking powder, baking soda, and salt. In a medium bowl, stir together yogurt, banana, lemon juice, lemon zest, and vanilla extract. Add wet mixture to dry mixture and stir until combined. Let batter sit for 5 min. Form rounded tablespoon balls of dough and spread evenly on baking sheet. The batter should be somewhat soft and sticky but should hold together when you roll cookies into a ball. Pat each cookie down lightly with fingers since they will not spread in the oven. Bake for about 23 min. Remove cookies from oven and place baking sheet on a cooling rack. Allow to cool completely.

Glaze:
½ c cashews, soaked
1 tbsp coconut oil, melted
juice of a large lemon
2 tbsp pure maple syrup
2 tbsp water
½ tsp vanilla 

Place cashews in a bowl and cover with hot water, set aside. After 30 min (or more) drain soaked cashews. Place in high-speed blender with the rest of the glaze ingredients. Glaze should be completely smooth and creamy. Transfer to a small bowl and freeze until cookies have cooled.

Use a fork to drizzle glaze over top. You can also put glaze into a plastic baggie, cut off the corner, and drizzle that way. Store cooking in an air-tight container in the refrigerator.
