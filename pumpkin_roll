Pumpkin Roll
  --Cook's Country
  
1 c cake flour
2 tsp pumpkin pie spice
1/2 tsp baking soda
1/2 tsp salt
5 eggs
1 c sugar
1 c canned pumpkin puree
3 c cream cheese frosting
confertioners' sugar and store-bought spiced nuts for garnish

Adjust oven rack to middle position and heat oven to 350F. Grease 18x13" rimmed baking sheet and line with greased parchment paper. Whisk flour, spice, baking soda, and salt in medium bowl; set aside. With electric mixer on medium-high speed, beat eggs and sugar until pale yellow and thick, 6-10 min. Add pumpkin and mix on low until incorporated. Fold in flour mixture until combined. Spread batter evenly in prepared pan. Bake until cake is firm and springs back when touched, ~15 min. Before cooling, run knife around edge of cake to loosen, and turn out onto clean sheet of parchment paper that has been dusted with confectioners' sugar. Gently peel off parchment attached to cake and discard. Roll cake and fresh parchment into log and cool completely, ~1 hr. To Assemble: Gently unroll cake and spread with frosting, leaving 1" border at edges. Re-roll cake snugly, leaving parchment behind. Wrap cake firmly in plastic wrap and chill completely, at least 1 hr or up to 2 days. Remove plastic, dust with confectioners' sugar, and garnish with spiced nuts.
