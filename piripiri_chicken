Piri Piri Chicken with Slaw

Chicken:
6 red freson chiles, roughly chopped
4 red thai chiles, stemmed
5 garlic cloves
1/4 c red wine vinegar
2 1/2 tsp kosher salt
2/3 c olive oil + 1 tbps for grilling
1 1/2 lbs boneless, skinless chicken thighs, cut into 1 1/2" chunks
bamboo skewers, soaked in water for at least 1 hr or metal skewers

In a food processor, combine the chiles, garlic, vinegar, and salt. Pulse until finely minced. With the machine running, add 2/3 c olive oil and pulse until smooth. Set aside.
In a large bowl, toss the chicked with 2/3 c of the piri piri mixture to coat. Cover and chill for at least 30 min or preferably overnight. Cover and chill remaining piri piri sauce.
Prepare a grill for medium-hot heat or place a grill pan over medium high heat. Thread 4-5 pieces of chicken onto each skewer. Using a pastry brush, coat the grill with the tbsp of olive oil. Grill the chicken, turning and basting often with the remaining 1/3 c of sauce, until the chicken is cooked through and charred in spots, 12-15 min.

1/4 small head green cabbage, very thinly sliced (~2 1/2 c)

1/4 c loosely packed fresh mint leaves, thinly sliced
2 tbsp olive oil
2 tbsp fresh lime juice
1 tbsp finely grated lime zest
kosher salt to taste

In a large mixing bowl, toss the cabbage, cucumber, onion, mint, olive oil, lime juice and zest. Season with salt.
