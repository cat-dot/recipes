Chili Colorado
  --Rick Martinez

5 ancho, stemmed and seeded
2 pasillas, stemmed and seeded
2 guajillos, stemmed and seeded
8 c chicken stock, divided
2 lb boneless pork shoulder, cut into 1/2" pieces
salt and pepper
vegetable oil
6 cloves garlic, chopped
2 bay leaves
1 tbsp ground cumin
2-3 tsp chopped fresh sage
2-3 tsp chopped fresh mexican oregano

Bring 3 c chicken stock to a boil. Place chiles in heatproof bowl and cover with boiling stock, cover with plastic wrap for ~30 min until they are plump and tender. Put chiles and liquid into a blender and puree until very smooth. Season pork with salt and pepper, and brown meat in a large, heavy pot over medium high heat with a little bit of vegetable oil. Add garlic, bay leaves, cumin, sage, and oregano. Stir for ~1 min, or until very fragrant. Add in remaining chicken stock and simmer uncovered for ~1 hr. Then, stir in chile puree and simmer for another 45 min until meat is very tender and the sauce is a thick, mahogany red color. Season with salt and pepper to taste.


Notes: Make sure chiles are soft and pliable, like a raisin. Serve with tortillas (and beans a la charra if desired)
