Cold Soba with Perilla Oil
  --Hana Asbrink
  
2 dried soba noodle bundles (each bundle is 90-100 g or 3 to 3 1/2 oz)
3 tbsp perilla oil
2 to 2 1/2 tbsp shoyu
1 tsp unseasoned rice vinegar
1 tsp granulated sugar
2 tbsp toasted sesame seeds
1 sheet roasted dried seaweed (Korean gim or Japanese nori), unseasoned
julienned cucumber (optional garnish)
shredded cooked chicken (optional)

Bring a medium pot filled with water to boil for the soba. In a large mixing bowl, combine perilla oil, shoyu, rice vinegar, and sugar. Stir sauce until sugar is dissolved. Set aside. In a mortar and pestle, grind the sesame seeds well, leaving some coarse. Tear the dried seaweed finely and set aside (alternately, put the sheet of gim in a plastic produce bag or zip-top bag and crush with your hand until fine). Cook soba noodles for 4 min exactly (yes, even if your package suggests otherwise!). Prepare a colander and bowl in the sink. Drain in a colander and immediately transfer noodles to the bowl and fill with cold water, rubbing and rinsing off excess starch. Repeat 3-4 times until water runs relatively clear. Thoroughly drain noodles of any excess water in the colander. Add the noodles to the mixing bowl with sauce. Toss until thoroughly combined. To plate, divide dressed noodles between 2 bowls (no dressing left behind!) and top with crushed sesame seeds and dried seaweed. Add optional garnishes of julienned cucumbers and shredded chicken, if using. Serve immediately.
