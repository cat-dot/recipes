Canadian Butter Tarts
  --Elizabeth Baird

Pastry:
1 1/2 c ap flour
1/4 tsp salt
1/4 c cold butter, cubed
1/4 cold lard, cubed (can sub butter)
1 large egg yolk
1 tbsp fresh lemon juice
ice water

In a large bowl, combine flour and salt. Use a pastry blender to cut in the butter and lard until the mixture is in fine crumbs. In a 1 c measuring cup, use a small whisk of fork to combine the yolk, lemon juice, and enough ice water to come to 1/3 c. Gradually drizzle over the flour mixture, stirring briskly with a fork until the pastry holds together. You may need to add a more ice water to gather up the last of the dry bits. Press into a disc and wrap and chill until form. Let stand at room temp to soften a bit before rolling. On a floured surface, roll out pastry to a 1/8" thickness. Using a 4" round cookie cutter, cut out 12 circles, rerolling scraps if necessary. Fit into muffin cups. 

Filling:
1/2 c packed light brown sugar
1/2 c corn syrup
1 large, room temp egg
2 tbsp very soft butter
1 tsp vanilla
1 tsp fresh lemon juice
pinch of salt
1/3 c currants, sultana raisins, chopped walnuts or pecan halves

Preheat the oven to 450F. In a medium bowl, mix together the sugar, syrup, egg, butter, vanilla, lemon juice, and sal until smooth. Divide the currants (or whatever you use) among the pastry shells. Spoon the filling over the currants until 3/4 full. Bake in the bottom third of the oven for ~12 min or until filling is puffed and bubbly and pastry is golden. Let stand on a rack for a minute; immediately run a metal spatula around tarts to loosen. Carefully slide the spatula under the tarts and lift out to cool on a rack. Can fresse for a month or store in fridge for up to a week. Warm to serve.
