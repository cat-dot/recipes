Chinese Radish Cake

2 c jasmine rice
2 c water
5 tbsp vegetable oil, divided
1 1/2 lb daikon radish, peeled and coarsley chopped
1/2 c thinly slioced scallions + more for garnish
4 oz peeled and deveined shrimp, small dice
1/3 c diced chinese sausage
kosher salt to taste
hoisin sauce for serving

In a medium bowl, cover the jasmine rice with the water, then soak overnight. Line a 9x5" loaf pan with plastic wrap and set up a steamer large enough to fit the loaf pan over a pot of simmering water. In a large skillet, heat 2 tbsp oil over medium heat. Sweat the daikon and scallions until translucent, 10 min, making sure it doesn't brown. Transfer to a bowl and let cool. Return the pan to the heat with 1 tbsp of oil. Add the shrimp and chinese sausage, and cook until the shrimp is opaque, 2-3 min. Transfer to same bowl as daikon and let cool. In a blender, combine the soaked rice with the water it was soaked in and blend until smooth. Pour the puree over the daikon mixture and stir until incorporated. Season with salt, then pour into the prepared loaf pan. Cover the top with another piece of plastic wrap. Steam, covered, until the cake is set, 90 min. Remove from the steamer and refrigerate overnight. The next day, unwrap the cake and cut in half lengthwise, then cut into 1/2" slices. In a large nonstick skillet, heat the remaining 2tbsp oil over medium high heat. Working in 2 batches, sear the slices, flipping once, until golden brown and crisp, 2-3 min per side. Arrange on a platter and drizzle with hoisin sauce. Garnish with sliced scallions and serve.
