  --Cook's Illustrated

Dough:
1 1/3 c (7 1/3oz) bread flour
1/2 c (3oz) semolina flour
2 tsp instant or rapid rise yeast
2 tsp sugar
1/2 c + 2 tbsp (5oz) warm water (115F)
1/4 c (2oz) mild lager
2 tsp distilled white vinegar
1 1/2 tsp evoo
1 tsp salt
vegetable oil spray
ap flour

Adjust oven rack 4-5" from broiler element, set pizza stone on rack, and heat oven to 500F. Process bread flour, semolina, yeast, and sugar in food processor until combined, ~2s. With processor runnin, slowly pour water, lager, vinegar, and oil through feed tube; process until dough is just combined and no dry flour remains, ~10s. Divide the dough into 2 equal pieces and shape each into smooth ball. Spray 11" circle in center of large sheet of parchment paper with oil spray. Place 1 ball in center, spray top with oil spray. Using rolling pin, roll dough into 10" circle. Cover with second sheet of parchment. Using rolling pin and your hands, continue to roll and press dough into 11 1/2" circle. Set aside and repeat with second dough ball. Let dough stand at room temp until slightly puffy, 30 min.

Sauce:
28 oz can whole peeled tomatoes, drained
1 tbsp evoo
3 anchovy fillets, rinsed and patted dry (optional)
1 tsp salt
1 tsp dried oregano
1/2 tsp sugar
1/4 tsp pepper
1/8 tsp red pepper flakes

Process all ingredients in food processor until smooth, ~30 s. Transfer to medium bowl. Extra sauce can be refrigerated for up to 1 week or frozen for up to a month.

Assembly:
1 oz (1/2c) parmesan cheese, grated fine
6 oz (1 1/2c) whole milk mozzarella, shredded

When dough has rested for 20 min, heat broiler for 10 min. Remove top piece of parchment from 1 disc of doughand dust top of dough lightly with ap flour. Using hands or pastry brush, spreadflour evenly over dough, brushing off any excess. Liberally dust pizza peel with ap flour. Flip dough onto peel, parchment side up; carefully remove parchment and discard. Using back of spoon or ladle, spread 1/2 c sauce in thin layer over surface of dough, leaving 3/4" border around edge. Sprinkle 1/4 c parmesan evenly over sauce, followed by 3/4 c mozzarella. Slide pizza carefully onto stone and return oven to 500F. Bake until crust is well browned and cheese is bubbly and beginning to brown 8-12 min, rotating pizza halfway through baking. Transfer to wire rack to cool for 5 min before slicing and serving.
