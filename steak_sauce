Steak Sauce
-- Josiah Citrin

1/2 c ketchup
1/4 c water
1/4 c dijon
1/4 c yellow mustard
1/4 c golden raisins
1/8 c balsamic vinegar
1/8 c apple cider vinegar
1/4 c oj
1/2 c worcestershire
1/4 c dark brown sugar, packed
3 white button mushrooms, wiped clean and sliced
2 anchovy fillets, packed in oil, and drained
2 garlic cloves, germ removed, and smashed
1 shallot, sliced
2 tbsp fresh tarragon leaves
1 1/2 tsp celery seeds
1 1/2 tsp fine sea salt
1/2 tsp freshly ground black pepper
1/4 tsp ground cloves
1/4 tsp ground cinnamon
1/4 tsp cayenne

In a large saucepan over medium high heat, add the ketchup, water, mustards, raisins, vinegars, oj, worcestershire, and sugar. Stir with a wooden spoon to combine. Add the mushrooms, anchovies, garlic, shallots, tarragon, celery seeds, salt, black pepper, cloves, cinnamon, and cayenne. Mix well to incorporate. Bring the sauce to a boil, and then reduce the heat to low. Gently simmer, uncovered, stirring occationally to dissolve the sugar, until the sauce is reduced and slightly thickened, 20-25 minutes. Working in batches if necessary, ladle the sauce into a blender, filling it no more than halfway. Puree on low for a few seconds, and then increase to medium speed until the sauce is completely smooth. Pour the sauce through a fine mesh strainer into a heatproof bowl, pushing the solids with the back of a spoon. Repeat with the remaining sauce until completely blended and strained. Let cool and transfer the sauce to a tightly covered bowl or individual jars/containers and refrigerate. The sauce may be stored, covered, in the refrigerator for up to 2 weeks and frozen for up to 3 months.
