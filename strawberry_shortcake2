Strawberry Shortcake
  - Ted Hopson
  
Strawberries:
1½ lb strawberries, hulled and halved
¼ c granulated sugar
¼ c cognac
½ tsp almond extract
Pinch kosher salt

In a large bowl, toss all the strawberry ingredients to coat. Cover in plastic wrap and let sit at room temperature for 3 hrs, tossing the strawberries every hour.

Biscuits:
3 c ap flour
1 c buttermilk
⅔ c heavy cream
6 tbsp unsalted butter, cubed and chilled
¼ c honey
2 tbsp baking powder
1 tsp kosher salt

Preheat the oven to 425° and line a sheet pan with parchment paper. In a large bowl, add all the biscuit ingredients and mix until a dough forms, being careful not to overwork. Divide the dough into 12 ¼ c pucks and drop onto the prepared sheet pan. Bake for 6 min, then rotate the pan and decrease the temperature to 375°. Continue to cook until golden brown, another 8-10 min. Remove from the oven and let cool.

Marscapone:
1½ c mascarpone cheese, softened
6 tbsp heavy cream
2 tbsp granulated sugar
Pinch kosher salt

In a medium bowl, whisk all the ingredients until smooth.

Garnish:
½ c toasted sliced almonds
Confectioners' sugar

Slice each biscuit in half and arrange on a plate. Top each bottom biscuit with some of the macerated strawberries and their juices, then dollop some of the mascarpone cream over the strawberries. Divide the remaining strawberries over the mascarpone and sprinkle each with some toasted almonds. Place the other halves of each biscuit on top, garnish with more almonds and confectioners' sugar, then serve.
