Hamburger Buns
  --Meghan #foxandbriar

2 tbsp active dry yeast
1 c + 2 tbsp warm water ~110F
1/3 c vegetable oil
1/4 c sugar
1 large egg beaten
1 tsp salt
3-3 1/2 c ap flour

Add yeast and warm water to a large bowl. Add oil and sugar; let stand for 5 min. After 5 min, mixture should be foamy. Whisk in egg. Slowly mix in the salt and flour. Continue to add flour until you have a soft dough. Using a dough hook, knead in a mixer for 3-5 min, until dough is smooth and elastic. (If you don't want to use a mixer, you can knead by hand on a lightly floured surface.) Do not let rise. Divide into 8 equal pieces; shape each into a ball. Preheat oven to 425F. Place the dough balls on a greased or lined baking sheet. Cover with a kitchen towel and let rest for 10 min. 

Topping:
1 egg
1 tbsp water
2 tbsp sesame seeds

Mix egg with water in small bowl. Brush the buns with an egg wash, then sprinkle with sesame seeds. Bake until golden brown, 8-12 min. Store buns in an airtight container for up to 2 days. Or, freeze for up to one month. 


Notes: I used milk instead of egg wash - worked just fine. Recipe claims this takes only 40 min - took me closer to 1 hr
