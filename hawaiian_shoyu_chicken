Hawaiian Style Shoyu Chicken
  --Jess Larson

6 bone-in, skin-on chicken thighs (~2–3 lb)
1 c water
2/3 c shoyu
2/3 c dark brown sugar
4 green onions, thinly sliced
5 cloves garlic, finely chopped or grated
3" piece ginger, finely chopped or grated
optional: cornstarch slurry

Add the water, shoyu, brown sugar, green onions, garlic, and ginger to a bowl. Whisk to combine. Set aside or store in an airtight container in the refrigerator for up to 1 week. Pour the braising liquid into a heavy-bottomed pot or Dutch oven with a lid. Nestle the chicken thighs in the pot, submerging them in the shoyu braising liquid as much as possible. Bring to a boil over high heat, then reduce to low. Cover and simmer for 30-35 min, until the chicken is fall-apart tender and cooked through. (optional) Preheat your oven’s broiler to its highest setting, ensuring an oven rack is positioned ~6" below the broiler. Transfer the chicken thighs to a small baking sheet. Place under the broiler for 4-5 min, rotating the baking sheet halfway through, until the chicken skin is crispy and caramelized. As the chicken broils, you can also thicken the braising liquid. Increase the heat under the pot to high. Boil 5-10 min, until reduced as desired. Serve immediately, spoon the thickened shoyu sauce over the chicken and garnish with thinly sliced green onion as desired. Enjoy!


Notes: For even more flavorful shoyu chicken, you can let the chicken thighs soak in the shoyu sauce. Pour your prepped shoyu braising liquid over the chicken thighs and store in an airtight container in the refrigerator for up to 3 days. Slow cooker: Slow cook on high for 3-4 hr or on low for 5-6 hr until the chicken is fall-apart tender.
