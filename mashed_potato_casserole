Mashed Potato Casserole
  --Cook's Country

4	lbs russet potatoes, peeled and cut into 1" chunks
½	c half-and-half
½	c low-sodium chicken broth
12	tbsp unsalted butter (1 1/2 sticks), cut into pieces
1	garlic clove, minced
2	tsp dijon mustard
2	tsp salt
4	large eggs
¼	c finely chopped fresh chives

Adjust oven rack to upper-middle position and heat oven to 375F. Bring potatoes and water to cover by 1" to boil in large pot over high heat. Reduce heat to medium and simmer until potatoes are tender, ~20 min. Heat half-and-half, broth, butter, garlic, mustard, and salt in saucepan over medium-low heat until smooth, ~5 min; keep warm. Drain potatoes and transfer to large bowl. With electric mixer on medium-low speed, beat potatoes, slowly adding half-and-half mixture, until smooth and creamy, 1 min. Scrape down bowl; beat in eggs 1 at a time until incorporated, ~1 min. Fold in chives. Transfer potato mixture to greased 3-quart baking dish (it will be soupy). Bake until potatoes rise and begin to brown, ~35 minutes. Let cool 10 min. Serve.


Notes: The baking dish with the potatoes can be covered with plastic and refrigerated for up to 24 hr. When ready to bake, let the casserole sit at room temperature for 1 hr. Increase baking time by 10 min. For better browning and an impressive presentation, use a fork to make a peaked design on top of the potato casserole.
