Spicy Fried Catfish
  --Rosie Mayes

2 lbs Catfish Nuggets
1 c self rising flour
1/2 c yellow cornmeal
1/2 c hot sauce
2 medium sized eggs
2 tsp your favorite cajun seasoning
2- 2 1/2 c oil to fry with

Make sure that the fish is nice and clean before anything else, then set to the side. In a large bowl add the flour, cornmeal, and cajun seasoning. Mix well. In a separate bowl beat the 2 eggs, then add in the hot sauce, and mix. Next add the fish into the bowl with the hot sauce & egg mixture. Make sure that the fish is nicely coated with the wet mixture, then coat with the flour mixture. Once all of the fish is coated, let it set for ~5 min so that the cornmeal & flour mixture can stick well. Heat the oil 350-375 F. Once the oil is nice and hot, carefully add the fish into the skillet or deep fryer, but do not overcrowd. Fry the fish until golden brown, then remove from the oil, and set on a paper towel lined plate or cookie sheet. Let sit until it's cool enough to eat. Serve & Enjoy
