  --America's Test Kitchen
  
3 tbsp unsalted butter + extra for dish
2 1/2 oz Manchego cheese, grated (1 1/4 c)
8 oz cherry tomatoes
salt and pepper
2 garlic cloves, minced
8 oz Swiss chard, stemmed and cut into 1/2" pieces
2 tbsp cornstarch
1 1/4 c half-and-half
4 large eggs

Adjust 1 oven rack to middle position and second rack 6" from broiler element. Heat oven to 350F. Grease bottom and sides of broiler-safe 2-qt gratin dish with butter and sprinkle 1/4 c Manchego evenly over bottom and sides of dish. Melt 1 tbsp butter in 10" nonstick skillet over medium-low heat. Add tomatoes, 1/2 tsp salt, and 1/4 tsp pepper and cook until tomatoes begin to break down and release their liquid, 3-5 min; transfer tomatoes to prepared dish. Wipe skillet clean with paper towels and melt remaining 2 tbsp butter over medium-low heat. Add garlic and cook, stirring occasionally, until lightly golden, ~2 min. Stir in chard and increase heat to medium-high. Cover and cook until chard is wilted but still bright green, ~2 min. Uncover and cook, stirring frequently, until liquid evaporates, about 1 minute. Transfer chard to gratin dish and spread evenly over tomatoes. Whisk cornstarch and 1/2 tsp salt together in medium bowl. Whisk in half-and-half, eggs, and 3/4 c Manchego until thoroughly combined. Pour egg mixture over tomatoes and greens. Sprinkle with remaining 1/4 c Manchego. Bake gratin on middle rack until toothpick inserted in center comes out clean, 30-40 min, rotating dish halfway through baking. Remove gratin from oven. Heat broiler. Broil gratin on top rack until cheese is golden brown, ~2 min. Let gratin cool until custard has set up, ~5 min. Serve.
