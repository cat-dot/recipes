Ghormeh Sabzi (Chicken and Kidney Bean Stew)

3 tbsp oil
1 1/2 lb boneless, skinless chicken thighs, cut into 1" cubes
kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper to taste
1 tbsp ground tumeric
1 large yellow onion, finely chopped
6 ox (12 medium) scallions, minced
2 c minced parsley + more for garnish
1 1/2 c minced cilantro + more for garnish
4 c chicken stock
1 tbsp dried fenugreek leaves
5 dried black persian limes
2x15 oz cans kidney beans, drained

In a large pot or dutch oven, heat the oil over medium high heat. Season the chicken with salt and pepper, and add to the pot. Cook, turning as needed, until browned on all sides, 8-10 min. Using a slotted spoon, transfer the chicken to a plate and set aside. Add the tumeric and onion to the pot, and cook, stirring often, until softened, 5-6 min. Add the scallions, parsley, and cilantro, and cook until wilted and dark green, 5 min. Return the chicken to the pot and add the stock, fenugreek, and limes. Bring to a simmer until the chicken is tender and the liquid has reduced, 25 min. Halfway through cooking, pierce 3 of the limes with a paring knife. Add the kidney beans and cook until warmed through, another 5 min. Serve, garnish with parsley and cilantro.
