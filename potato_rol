2 medium russet potatoes (128 g), peeled and cut into 1" pieces
1 tbsp (9 g) active dry yeast
½ c (100 g) granulated sugar, divided
7-7½ c (875-938 g) ap flour, divided
¼ c (57 g) unsalted butter, softened

In a large saucepan, bring potatoes and water to a boil over medium-high heat; cook until tender, 10-12 min. Drain, reserving 2 c liquid. Press potatoes through a potato ricer, and let cool completely. In the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with the paddle attachment, combine 2 c reserved potato water (at 110°F), yeast, and 2 tsp (8 g) sugar. Let stand until mixture is foamy, ~5 min. Stir in mashed potatoes, 3 c (375 g) flour, softened butter, kosher salt, lemon juice, eggs, and remaining sugar; beat at medium speed until smooth. Gradually add remaining 4-4½ c (500-563 g) flour, beating until a soft dough forms. Turn out dough onto a heavily floured surface, and knead until smooth and elastic, 2-3 min, sprinkling surface with additional flour as needed. Spray a large bowl with cooking spray. Place dough in bowl, turning to grease top. Cover and let rise in a warm, draft-free place (75F), until doubled in size,~2 hrs. Line a baking sheet with parchment paper, and spray with cooking spray. Divide dough into 24 equal pieces. Roll each piece into a ball. Place on prepared pan. Cover and let stand in a warm, draft-free place (75F). until puffed, ~45 min. Preheat oven to 350F. Bake until golden brown, 25-30 min. Brush with melted butter, and sprinkle with flaked salt.
