Ginger Cakes

2 1/2 c ap flour
2/3 c sugar
1/4 tsp salt
1 tsp baking soda
1 tbsp ground ginger
1 tsp ground nutmeg
1/2 tsp cinnamon
1/2 c (1 stick) unsalted butter, softened
1/2 c molasses
2 tbsp heavy cream
confectioners' sugar for garnish

Preheat the oven to 375F. Line 2 baking sheets with parchment paper and set aside. In a large bowl, mix together the dry ingredients. Mix the butter into the dry ingredients using a pastry cutter, or your fingers, until well incorporated. In a small saucepan, warm the molasses and cream over low heat so that they blend together, stirring often. Add the molasses mixture to the butter mixture and mix into a dough. turn the dough out onto a lightly floured surface and roll out to a 1/4" thickness. Cut into desired shape and place on the baking sheets. Bake for 10 min, until firm on the edges and slightly soft in the center. Let cool slightly, then dust with confectioners' sugar and serve.
