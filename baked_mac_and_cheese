Bake Mac and Cheese
  --America's Test Kitchen

12 oz (3 c) elbow macaroni
2 1/2 c water
12 oz can evaporated milk
1/2 tsp dry mustard
salt and pepper
6 oz sharp cheddar cheese, shredded (1½ cups)
6 oz American cheese, shredded (1½ cups)
1/2 c panko bread crumbs, toasted

Adjust oven rack to middle position and heat oven to 375 F. Spray 13x9" baking dish with vegetable oil spray. Spread macaroni into prepared dish. Whisk 2 c water, evaporated milk, dry mustard, 1 tsp salt, and 1/2 tsp pepper together in bowl. Pour into baking dish and stir gently to combine. Cover tightly with aluminum foil and bake, stirring occasionally, until macaroni is nearly tender and most liquid has been absorbed, ~30 min. Remove dish from oven and stir macaroni thoroughly, scraping sides and bottom of dish. Stir in remaining 1/2 c water, cheddar cheese, and American cheese. Cover dish with foil and return to oven to bake until macaroni is tender and cheese is melted, 5-8 min. Remove dish from oven. Stir to coat pasta evenly in sauce, and let cool for 10 min. Sprinkle with toasted panko before serving.
