Roman-Style Fried Cardoons

1 1/2 lb (1 bunch) cardoons, trimmed and peeled
1/2 c white wine
2 thyme sprigs
1 lemon, halved
3/4 c ap flour
4 eggs beaten
1 1/2 c dry bread crumbs
canola oil for frying
kosher salt to taste
freshly grated parmesan for garnish
chopped parsley for garnish
lemon wedges for serving

Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil. Cut the cardoons into 3x1" pieces and add them to the pot, along with the wine, thyme and lemon, and cook until the cardoons are tender, 1 hr. Drain, discarding the lemon and thyme, and let cool. Line up 3 shallow dishes and fill with flour, eggs, and bread crumbs, respectively. One at a time, dredge the cardoons in the flour, egg, and bread crumbs, then the egg and bread crumbs again. Transfer each to a plate until ready to fry. In a 6 quart dutch oven, heat 2" of canola oil to 350F. Line a plate with paper towels and set aside. Working in batches, fry until golden brown, 1-2 min. Transfer to the prepared plate to drain, immediately seasoning with salt. Garnish with grated parmesan and parsley, then serve with lemon wedges.
