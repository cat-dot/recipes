  --Nik Sharma
  
1 lb spaghetti
table salt for cooking pasta
4 tsp red Sichuan peppercorns
3 tbsp evoo
2 garlic cloves, minced
1 c chicken broth
1 c crème fraîche
3 tbsp white miso
2 tsp grated lemon zest + 2 tbsp juce
1 tsp pepper
2 tbsp chopped fresh parsley
parmesan cheese (optional)

Bring 4 qt water to boil in large pot. Heat dry medium saucepan over medium heat for 1 min. Add 4 tsp red Sichuan peppercorns and toast until fragrant, ~1 min, stirring frequently. Transfer to mortar and pestle and let cool to room temperature, then grind until coarsely ground; set aside. Once water is boiling, add 1 lb spaghetti and 1 tbsp table salt and cook, stirring often, until al dente. Reserve 1 c cooking water, then drain pasta and return it to pot. Cook 3 tbsp evoo, 2 minced garlic cloves, and half of reserved ground Sichuan peppercorns over medium heat in now-empty saucepan until fragrant, ~1 min. Stir in 1 c chicken broth and bring to boil. Reduce heat to medium-low and simmer until reduced by half, 4-5 min. Whisk in 1 c crème fraîche, 3 tbsp white miso, 2 tsp grated lemon zest + 2 tbsp juice, and 1 tsp ground black pepper. Increase heat to medium-high and return to brief simmer. Season with salt and pepper to taste. Add sauce and 1/2 c reserved cooking water to pasta and toss to combine. Adjust consistency with remaining reserved cooking water as needed. Stir in remaining ground Sichuan peppercorns, then season with salt and pepper to taste. Sprinkle with 2 tbsp chopped fresh parsley and serve immediately with Parmesan, if using.
