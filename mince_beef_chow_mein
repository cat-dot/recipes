Mince Beef Chow Mein
  --Nagi, tin eats

Sauce:
1 1/2 tbsp light soy sauce or all-purpose soy sauce
1 1/2 tsp dark soy sauce (Note 2)
1 1/2 tbsp oyster sauce (Note 3)
1 1/2 tbsp Chinese cooking wine (Shaoxing) 
1 1/2 tsp white sugar
Pinch white pepper

Mix ingredients in a small bowl then set aside. Some is used to flavour the beef, then the rest for the noodles.

1 1/2 tsp cornflour / cornstarch
3 tbsp water

Mix the cornflour / cornstarch and water in a separate small bowl.

chow mein:
200g/7 oz chow mein noodles, or other thin yellow egg noodles or 3 ramen cakes
1 1/2 tbsp canola oil
2 garlic cloves , finely minced
200g/7 oz beef mince / ground beef (any fat %)
3 green onion stems , cut into 5cm/2″ lengths, white and green parts separated
1 egg
2 c green cabbage , finely sliced (or Chinese cabbage)
1 carrot , peeled, cut into thin batons
1 heaped c bean sprouts

Prepare noodles per packet directions then drain. Heat the oil in a large non-stick pan over high heat. Cook garlic for 10 s, then add the beef and cook until you can no longer see pink. Add 1 1/2 tbsp of the Sauce and the white part of the green onions. Cook for another 2 min to get the beef nicely caramelised. Mix the cornflour slurry into the remaining sauce. Add the egg into the pan then mix it through the beef, it will sort of scramble. Egg makes the beef stick to the noodles better! When the egg is mostly cooked, add the carrot and cabbage. Cook for 1 min until cabbage starts to wilt. Give the sauce a quick mix. Add the bean sprouts, noodles and sauce into the pan. Toss well for 1 min or until sauce is dispersed through the noodles. Add green part of green onions. Toss for another 1 min


Notes: Noodles – Chow mein noodles are sort of dry and crinkly, rather than oily and straight like hokkien noodles, lo mein noodles. But this dish can really be made with any noodles – or even spaghetti (yes really, who’s going to know once tossed in chow mein sauce??). Use the same weight.
