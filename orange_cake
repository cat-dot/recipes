   --Carrie Vasios Mullins

Cake:
1 1/2 c chopped walnuts
1 c flour
1 tbsp baking powder
1/2 tsp salt
4 eggs
1 1/2 c sugar
1 tbsp zested orange peel
1/2 c fresh oj
1/2 c olive oil + more for greasing pan

Preheat oven 350F. Lightly grease springform pan with olive oil. Place walnuts in food processor; pulse until finely ground. In medium bowl, whisk together walnuts, flour, baking powder, and salt. Set aside. In a large bowl, beat eggs with an electric mixer until frothy, ~2 min. Add sugar to eggs and beat until creamy, ~3 min. Stir in walnut mixture. Add zest, oj, and olive oil and beat until combined. Pour batter into prepared springform pan and bake until golden and a cake tester comes out clean, ~1 hr. 

Topping:
1 1/2 c walnut halves
2/3 c sugar
coarse sea salt
powdered sugar

Line a baking sheet with silpat. Place sugar in a medium heavy bottomed sauce pan over medium high heat. Cook sugar, stirring occasionally, until completely melted and light amber in color. Immediately add walnuts, and stir to combine. Pour walnuts onto prepared sheet, working quickly to spread them out. Sprinkle them immediately with salt.


Dust top of cake with powdered sugar until evenly coated. Lightly break up any large chunks of walnuts and spread evenly over top of cake.
