Thai Curry Poached Fish
  --Zena, Zena's kitchen

1 heaped tbsp good-quality Thai red curry paste (see Notes)
1 tbsp fish sauce
1 tsp palm sugar or light brown sugar
1 tsp ground turmeric
400ml tin good-quality coconut milk (70% or more coconut extract)
400ml chicken stock (for a richer, thicker broth, substitute for the same volume of coconut milk)
10g fresh ginger, grated
4 cod loins or fillets (around 150g each), or any flaky white fish
1 small handful fresh coriander, finely chopped
chilli oil and lime wedges, to serve

Place the Thai red curry paste, fish sauce, palm sugar, ground turmeric, coconut milk, chicken stock and fresh ginger in a medium saucepan and season with a generous pinch of salt. Whisk to combine. Bring to a boil over medium-high heat, whisking to combine, then reduce the heat to low, cover and simmer for 15 min. Add the cod fillets to the coconut broth, then cover and cook until the cod fillets are just cooked through, 5-8 min depending on their thickness. When done, the flesh will flake when gently pressed. To serve, carefully transfer the cod fillets to a shallow serving bowl, then ladle the broth over the top. Finish with the fresh coriander and optional drizzle of chilli oil. I recommend serving this with rice (it soaks up all of that deliciously fragrant Thai curry broth), a side of steamed veg, and a few lime wedges for squeezing over.
