Vegan Creamed Kale
  --Dianne Wenz, Dianne's Vegan Kitchen

1 tsp neutral-flavored oil
2 medium-sized shallots minced
4 cloves garlic minced
2 bunches kale stems removed and chopped (~16 oz)
1/2 c vegetable stock
1 1/2 c raw cashews soaked for two hr, drained and rinsed
3/4 c water
2 tbsp lemon juice
1/2 tsp sea salt

Heat the oil in a large pot over medium high heat. Cook the shallots for ~5 min, stirring occasionally, until they being to brown. Add the garlic and cook for another minute or two. Add the kale and stock to the pot and stir. Saut√© until the kale has begun to wilt. Let cook for ~5 min until most of the liquid has absorbed. While the kale is cooking, mix together the cashews, water, lemon juice, and salt in a high speed blender or food processor until smooth and creamy. If the mixture is too thick, add a little more water a tbsp at a time. Add the cashew cream to the pot with the kale and mix well. Cook for another 2-3 min, stirring frequently, until the cream is heated throughout. 


Notes: Can add nooch to the cashew cream when blending to add cheesy flavor. Cashew cream can be made ahead, lasts 5 days in refrigerator.
