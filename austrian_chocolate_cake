Combine milk, sugar, butter, and chocolate, and bring to a boil over medium heat. Let cool slightly and beat in egg yolks and the flour sifted with the baking powder. Beat 5 min by hand or 2 min with electric beater at med speed. Beat egg whites until stiff but not dry, and fold into the chocolate mixture. Pour into well buttered 10" ring mold. Bake in 325F oven for 50 min. Do not bake until dry and too firm, cake should be moist in the center when it is removed from the oven. Let cake cool in the mold for 15 min before turning out.

1/2 c almonds, toasted and finely chopped
1/2 c filberts, toasted and finely chopped

Praline Butter Cream:
1 stick butter, softened
1 c praline powder
1/4 c confectioners' sugar

Cream butter in electric mixer. Gradually add praline powder and sugar, beating until smooth and creamy.
