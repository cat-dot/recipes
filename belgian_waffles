2 large eggs
1/2 tsp vanilla extract
1 3/4 c whole milk
12 c half-n-half
8 tbsp unsalted butter, cut into 1" pieces
3 tbsp sugar

In a large bowl, whisk together the eggs and vanilla. Set aside. In a small sauce pan, heal the milk, half-n-half, and butter over low heat until the butter is almost melted, 4-6 min. Remove from the heat and whisk in the sugar, then slowly pour into the egg mixture, whisking until smooth. In a large bowl, whisk together the ap flour, semolina flour, cornstarch, salt, baking powder, and yeast. Slowly pour the egg mixture into the flour mixture, whisking until smooth. Cover the batter with a kitchen towel and let sit at room temp until it almost doubles in size, ~1.5 hrs. Makes 3 1/2 c batter.
