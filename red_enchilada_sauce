Red Enchilada Sauce
  --Douglas Cullen, Mexican Food Journal
  
8 ancho chiles mild fruity dried chili pods
4 pasilla chiles mild fruity dried chili pods
1 medium onion quartered
2 plum tomatoes
3 cloves garlic
1/2 tsp Mexican oregano
1/2 tsp marjoram
2 tbsp cooking oil
salt to taste

Toast the chiles in a hot pan until fragrant. (~10-15 s per side). Allow chiles to cool and then remove stems, seeds, and veins. Char the onion, tomatoes, and garlic in a hot pan. Place the chiles, onion, tomatoes, garlic oregano and marjoram in a pot with just enough water until the ingredients are almost covered. Bring to a boil and then reduce the heat to low. Simmer for 15 min to reconstitute the chiles and soften the veggies. Blend the chiles, onion, tomatoes, garlic, oregano marjoram, and the soaking water until smooth. It usually takes ~1 min. Add water little by little if necessary to blend. You may have to blend in two batches. Strain the mixture. Add 2 tbsp of cooking oil to a hot pan add the strained sauce to fry it. Reduce the heat and simmer for 30 min until the sauce has thickened. Add salt to taste. Allow the sauce to sit for at least 2 hr so that the flavors meld. Warm the sauce before using.


Notes: Sauce keeps in refrigerator for 5 days, freeze unused portion.
