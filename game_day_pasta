Heat the oil in a large skillet or dutch oven over medium heat. Add the onion, season with salt and pepper, and cook until softened, ~3 min. Add the garlic and cook for 1 more min. Add the eggplant and season with salt and pepper. Cook, stirring often, until the eggplant begins to soften, ~3 min. Add the wine and bay leaves, increase the heat to medium high, and cook until the wine has reduced by half, ~5 min. Stir in the tomato paste and cook for 30 s. Pour in the tomatoes and season with thyme, brown sugar, and 1 tsp kosher salt. Cook, simmering gently over medium low heat, until the tomatoes have thickened enough to lightly coat the back of a spoon, ~5 min. Be sure to crush the tomatoes with a wooden spoon if any large chunks remain. Fish out the bay leaves. Meanwhile, bring a large pot of salted water to boil. Add the pasta and cook according to package directions. Drain the pasta, reserving 1/2 c of the water. Return the pasta to the pot. Pour in the sauce, spinach, and basil, and mix with tongs to coat evenly. Squeeze lemon juice over the top and taste, seasoning with more salt if desired. If the pasta seems dry, drizzle a splach of the reserved water.
