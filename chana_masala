Combine garlic, ginger, chilies, 1 tbsp lemon juice, and 1/2 tsp kosher salt in a mortar and pestle or in a small food processor and pound or process until a fine paste is produced; set aside. Heat oil or ghee in a large saucepan or dutch oven over medium high heat until shimmering. All at once, add mustard see and cumin. As soon as they are aromatic (~15 s), add onion along with baking soda. Cook, stirring frequently, until onions start to leave a brown coating on bottom of pan, 3-4 min. Add 1 tbsp water, scrape up browned bits from pan, and continue cooking. Repeat this process until onions are a deep brown, ~10 min total. Immediately add paste and stir to combine. Add coriander, black pepper, tumeric, and 1 tsp garam masala. Stir until fragrant, ~30 s. Add tomatoes and crush them using a whisk or potatoe masher. Add chickpeas and cilantro, reserving some cilantro for garnish. Add 1/2 c water. Bring to a simmer, cover with lid slightly cracked, and reduce heat to maintain a gently bubbling. Cook, stirring occasionally, until liquid has reduced into a thick stew and spices have melded, ~30 min. Stir in remaining garam masala and lemon juice, Season to taste with salt. Serve with rice and/or naan, sprinkling cilantro on top.
