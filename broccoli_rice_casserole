Cheesey Broccoli and Rice Casserole


1 lb broccoli, stems peeled
kosher salt, to taste
2 c long-grain white rice
3 c chicken stock
12 oz Velveeta, cut into ½" pieces
2 c grated cheddar cheese
2 c grated Gruyère cheese
2 c heavy cream
freshly ground pepper, to taste
1 c panko bread crumbs (optional)
4 tbsp unsalted butter, melted

Preheat oven to 375F.Cut the broccoli into small florets and finely chop the peeled stems. Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil and prepare an ice bath. Blanch the broccoli until vibrant green but still crisp, 2 min. Transfer to the ice bath to cool, then drain.  In a medium saucepan, combine the rice and chicken stock over medium-high heat. Bring to a boil, then reduce the heat to a low simmer. Cook, covered, until the liquid has been absorbed and the rice is almost completely cooked, 10 min. In a large saucepan, combine the rice with the Velveeta, grated cheeses and heavy cream over medium heat. Cook, stirring often, until the cheeses have melted into a smooth sauce that coats the rice, 8 to 10 min. Fold in the blanched broccoli, then season with salt and pepper. Transfer the mixture to a 9x13" casserole dish and smooth into an even layer with a spatula. In a small bowl, toss the bread crumbs with the melted butter until evenly coated, then sprinkle the bread crumbs over the rice mixture. Bake until the bread crumbs are golden brown and the cheese is bubbling, 25 to 30 min.

Notes: can use cauliflower or carrots for the broccoli
