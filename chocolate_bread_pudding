Chocolate Bread Pudding
  --Kristina Razon

5 oz unsliced challah, or unsliced or sliced brioche bread
1 tbsp unsalted butter, plus more for the baking dish
4 oz semi-sweet chocolate or heaping 1/2 c semi-sweet chocolate chips, divided
1/4 c sugar
1 tbsp natural unsweetened cocoa powder
1/4 tsp instant espresso powder (optional)
1/4 tsp kosher salt
2 large eggs
1 c whole milk
1 tsp vanilla


Arrange a rack in the middle of the oven and heat the oven to 300F. Meanwhile, cut 5 oz challah or brioche bread into 1" cubes (~3 1/2 c). Place in a single layer on a baking sheet. Bake until the bread is dry but not browned, ~20 min. Set aside until mostly cool. Meanwhile, increase the oven temperature to 350F. Cut 1 tbsp unsalted butter into 4 pieces. Lightly coat an 8" ovenproof cast iron, skillet, or cake pan with more unsalted butter. Coarsely chop 4 oz semi-sweet chocolate or measure out heaping 1/2 c semi-sweet chocolate chips. Place 1/4 c sugar, 1 tbsp natural unsweetened cocoa powder, 1/4 tsp instant espresso powder if using, and 1/4 tsp kosher salt in a medium saucepan and whisk to combine. Add 2 large eggs and 1 c whole milk, and whisk until well-combined. Cook over medium heat, whisking occasionally, until warmed through (do not let come to a simmer), ~3 min. Remove the saucepan from the heat. Add the butter, half of the chocolate, and 1 tsp vanilla. Whisk until the butter and chocolate are melted and the mixture is smooth. Add the bread and gently stir to coat, pressing the bread down slightly to soak up the custard. Let sit for 15 min, stirring halfway through. Transfer to the skillet and arrange into an even layer. Pour any remaining liquid over the top. Sprinkle with the remaining chocolate. Bake until puffed and the custard is set, 20-27 minu. Let cool for 5 min before serving. Serve topped with powdered sugar or vanilla ice cream if desired.


Notes: suggest sifting the cocoa powder for easier whisking
