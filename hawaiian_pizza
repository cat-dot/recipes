Detroit-styled Hawaiian Pizza

Dough:
3/4 c water, heated to 115F
1 tsp instant dry yeast
pinch sugar
2 c bread flour
1 1/2 tsp kosher salt
olive oil for greasing

In the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with a dough hook, combine the water with the yeast and sugar. Let sit until frothy, 15 min. In a separate bowl, whisk together the flour and salt until fully incorporated. With the motor running, add the dry to the yeast mixture, and mix until a smooth dough forms. Transfer to a greased bowl and cover with plastic wrap. Allow to sit in a warm place for 30 min.

Grease a 9x13" nonstick pan liberally with olive oil and stretch out the dough with your fingers to cover the pan entirely. Cover the pan with plastic wrap and let rest for 3 hrs.

Sauce:
1 tbsp olive oil
1 garlic clove, minced
1 c crushed tomatoes
1 tsp sugar
1/4 tsp dried oregano
kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper to taste

In a samll saucepan, heat the olive oil over medium heat. Add the garlic and saute until lightly golden, 1-2 min. Add the crushed tomatoes, sugar and oregano. Reduce the heat to a low simmer and cook for 15 min. Season with salt and pepper. Let cool.

Toppings:
1 c (5 oz) pineapple chunks
1/4 c hot sauce
7 oz fresh mozzarella, torn into chunks
1/2 c sauce
4 oz sliced ham, torn into pieces

Preheat oven to 500F. In a small bowl, toss the pineapple chunks with the hot sauce to coat, then marinate in the fridge for 1hr.


Assemble the pizza by laying down the cheese over the dough, starting from the perimeter and working your way into the center. Spread 2 strips of sauce lengthwise along the pizza. Top with pieces of torn ham and then chunks of pineapple. Bake the pizza until the center is risen and the edges and cheese are golden brown, 15-17 min. Cut into squares and serve.
