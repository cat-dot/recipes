Roasted Squash and Shallot Soup

1 large butternut squash
4 large shallots
~1 tbsp olive oil
1/4 tsp salt
1 1/2 tsp fresh thyme
4 c low sodium chicken broth, vegetable broth, or chicken bone broth
1 bunch green onion, chopped (optional)
cracked black pepper (optional)
fresh goat cheese, crumbled (optional)

Preheat oven to 400F. Peel, de-seed, and dice squash. Peel and halve shallots. Toss squash and shallots with olive oil and salt. Place on a foil lined baking sheet and bake for 50 min or until tender. Turn occasionally. Let cool for 10 min. Place squash and shallots in a blender with thyme and broth. Be sure to remove the centerpiece of the blender lid to release steam, use a towel to avoid splatters. Blend until smooth. Pour into a large saucepan and cook over medium heat for 5 min or until thoroughly heated. Top with green onion, cracked black pepper, and crumbled goat cheese if desired.
