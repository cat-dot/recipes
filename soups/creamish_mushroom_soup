Creamish of Mushroom Soup
  --Chris Morocco

Soup:
1/4 c evoo
12 oz mixed mushrooms (eg. crimini, shiitake, oyster, and/or maitake)
1 large sweet onion, finely chopped
2 shallots, finely chopped
kosher salt
4 garlic cloves, thinly sliced
1/3 c dry white wine
1/4 c raw cashews
1 tbsp red or white miso
freshly ground black pepper

Heat oil in a large dutch oven or other heavy pot over medium high heat. Arrange mushrooms in a single layer and cook, undisturbed, until brown underneath, ~3 min. Stir and continue to cook, tossing occasionally, until golden brown all over, 5-7 min longer. Using a slotted spoon, transfer mushrooms to a plate, leaving oil behind. Add onion and shallots to pot; season with salt. Cook, stirring often and reducing heat as needed if beginning to brown, until very soft, 8-10 min. Add garlic and continue to cook, stirring occasionally, until softened and fragrant, ~3 min. Add win and cook until almost completely evaporated, ~1 min. Add 5 c water and return mushrooms to pot. Bring to a simmer. Transfer 2 c soup (including some mushrooms) to a blender and add cashews and miso. Puree until very smooth. Stir back into soup. Simmer, stirring occasionally, until flavors have melded, 10-15 min. Season with salt and pepper.

Garlicky Oil:
3 tbsp evoo
3 garlic cloves, thinly sliced
1 tbsp thyme leaves
1/2 tsp freshly cracked black pepper
kosher salt

Bring oil, garlic, thyme, and pepper to a simmer in a small saucepan over medium heat. Simmer gently until garlic is tender and just turning golden around the edges, ~3 min. Season with salt.


To server, ladle soup into bowls and drizzle with garlicky oil
