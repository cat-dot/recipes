  --Sur La Table

Soup:
3 tbsp unsalted butter
1 c finely diced yellow onion
1 1/2 lb asparagus, woody stems removed, cut crosswise into 1" pieces
3 1/4 c water
4 c baby spinach, coarsely chopped
1 tsp lemon zest
2 tbsp coarsely chopped fresh mint leaves
3/4 c heavy whipping cream
1 tbsp fresh lemon juice
Sea salt and freshly ground black pepper

Melt butter in a large saucepan over medium heat and add the onions; cook until soft and translucent, 3-4 min. Add the asparagus and water and simmer until asparagus is tender, ~15 min. Add spinach and cook just until the spinach wilts, ~2 min. Remove from heat and add lemon zest and mint. Taste and adjust seasoning with salt and pepper. Purée bisque using an immersion blender, or use a blender for a perfectly smooth and velvety texture. (If using a blender be cautious with hot liquids; vent the lid so hot air can escape. Blend on the lowest speed possible and use a towel to shield against splattering.) Return soup to the saucepan and whisk in cream and lemon juice; taste and adjust seasoning with salt and pepper.

Creme Fraiche:
5 oz container crème fraîche
1 tsp freshly ground black pepper
3 tbsp minced chives
Sea salt

In a small bowl, whisk together the crème fraîche, pepper, and chives; taste and adjust seasoning with salt.


To serve: Ladle soup in warmed soup bowls and dollop with crème fraîche.
