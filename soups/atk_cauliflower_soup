Cauliflower Soup
  --America's Test Kitchen

1 head cauliflower (2 lbs)
8 tbsp unsalted butter, cut into 8 pieces
1 leek, white and light green parts only, halved lengthwise, sliced thin, and washed thoroughly
1 small onion, halved and sliced thin
salt and pepper
4 1/2-5 c water
1/2 tsp sherry vinegar
3 tbsp minced fresh chives

Pull off outer leaves of cauliflower and trim stem. Using paring knife, cut around core to remove; thinly slice core and reserve. Cut heaping 1 c of 1/2" florets from head of cauliflower; set aside. Cut remaining cauliflower crosswise into 1/2" thick slices. Melt 3 tbsp butter in large saucepan over medium low heat. Add leek, onion, and 1 1/2 tsp salt; cook, stirring frequently, until leek and onion are softened but not browned, ~7 min. Increase heat to medium high; add 4 1/2 c water, sliced core, and half of sliced cauliflower; bring to simmer. Reduce heat to medium low and simmer gently for 15 min. Add remaining sliced cauliflower, return to simmer, and continue to cook until cauliflower is tender and brumbles easily, 15-20 min longer. While soup simmers, melt remaining butter in 8" skillet over medium heat. Add reserved florets and cook, stirring frequently, until florets are golden brown and butter is browned and imparts nutty aroma, 6-8 min. Remove skillet from heat and use slotted spoon to transfer florets to small bowl. Toss florets with vinegar and season with salt to taste. Pour browned butter into small bowl and reserve for garnish. Process soup in blender until smooth, ~45 s. Rinse out pan. Return puree to pan and return to simmer over medium heat, adjusting consistency with remaining water as needed, and season with salt to taste. Serve, garnishing individual bowls with browned florets, drizzle of browned butter, and chives, and season with pepper to taste.


Notes: Can sub white wine vinegar for sherry vinegar.
