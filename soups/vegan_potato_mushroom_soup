Vegan Potato and Mushroom Soup
  --Wil Yeung
  
1/2 lb cremini mushrooms, divided
3 tbsp evoo, divided + more for serving
1 large white onion (~12 oz)
2 to 3 garlic cloves
1 medium Russet potato (~10 oz)
Kosher salt, to taste
Cracked black pepper, to taste
1/4 c raw cashews
4 c vegetable stock (homemade or Better Than Bouillon) or water

Remove the stalks from the mushrooms and set aside, along with half of the mushroom caps. Slice the remaining mushroom caps thinly and set aside. Roughly slice the onion and lightly crush the garlic. Thinly slice the potato, then rinse and drain in cold water to remove the excess starch. Heat up a stockpot over medium heat with 2 tbp of the evoo. Add the onions and garlic; sauté until softened and golden brown at the edges, ~7 min. Add the potato, mushroom stalks, and whole mushroom caps. Season with salt and pepper. Cook, stirring occasionally, until the vegetables have softened, ~4 min. When the vegetables are browned, add the vegetable stock. Simmer on medium heat for 10 min. Remove from the heat. Add the cashews, stock, salt, pepper, and a drizzle of olive oil into a high-speed blender. Blitz on high until liquefied (don’t worry about any little bits of cashew on the sides of the blender—they’ll blend smooth when you add the rest of the soup). Carefully ladle the soup into the blender with the cashew cream. (If your blender is more than 3/4 full, do this in 2 batches.) Open the center of the blender lid to let steam escape, cover the hole with a folded kitchen towel, and blend the soup on high until smooth. Place the stockpot back onto medium heat. Add the remaining 1 tbsp of evoo and sliced mushroom caps; season with salt and pepper. Sauté until softened, ~3 min. Reserve a spoonful of the mushrooms to garnish the soup, then add the soup back into the pot and stir to combine. Ladle the soup into bowls. Finish with the reserved sautéed mushrooms, cracked pepper, and a drizzle of olive oil.
