Garnish:
1/4 c quinoa
1/4 c raw pumpkins seeds
1/2 tsp ground cumin
1/2 tsp chili powder
1/2 tsp sea salt

Heat a large saucepan over high heat. When pan is hot, add quinoa. Lower the heat to medium. Stir constantly until the grains start to pop (The popped grains will look like tiny white beads.) Stir in the pumpkin seeds continue stirring until quinoa has popped completely and pumpkin seeds are toasted, ~5 min. Turn off the heat and stir in seasonings.

Soup:
2 tbsp extra-virgin coconut or olive oil
1 large shallot, peeled and thinly sliced
2 medium garlic cloves, minced
2 tbsp minced ginger
2 tsp yellow curry powder
1/4 tsp sea salt
1 lb carrots, peeled and sliced into 1/2" pieces
1 bay leaf
3 1/2 c low-sodium vegetable broth
2/3 c coconut milk
1-2 tsp fresh lemon juice

Heat oil in a medium saucepan over medium heat. When oil is shimmering, add shallots, garlic and ginger and cook until fragrant, ~2 min. Stir in curry powder and salt and toast until fragrant, ~1 min. Add carrots, bay leaf and broth. Increase the heat to medium-high and bring the mixture to a boil, then reduce the heat and simmer until the carrots are very soft and tender, ~20 min. Remove bay leaf. Process the soup in a blender or with an immersion blender until smooth. (If using a blender be very careful, start on the lowest setting and vent the lid so that the hot steam can escape.) Return the soup to a saucepan over medium heat. Stir in the coconut milk. Taste and adjust the seasoning with salt and lemon juice. Serve with garnish.
