Butternut Squash Soup

1 butternut squash (~3lbs)
olive oil
salt
1 tsp butter, melted
2 pinches cayenne pepper
1 pinch cinnamon
vegetable oil
2 yellow onions, finely chopped (~2c)
2 medium carrots chopped (~1c)
2 medium celery ribs chopped (~1/2c)
1/2 jalapeno, seeded and finely chopped (optional)
1/4 c maple syrup
4 c chicken stock
1/2 c heavy cream (optional)
cider vinegar
1 granny smith apple, thinly sliced into matchsticks
1/2 c cilantro leaves

Preheat oven to 400F. Slice the squash in half lengthwise, scoop out the seeds and pulp and separate the seeds from the stringy pulp. Reserve the seeds. Use a sharp knofe to score the neck portion of the squash several times, then rub the flesh with olive oil and season with salt. Roast the squash cut side down on a baking sheet until tender and lightly caramelized, ~1 hr. In a colander, rinse the reserved seeds and dry with paper towels. Place on a sheet pan and toast in the oven for 5 min, until golden and fragrant. In a small bowl, whisk together the butter, cayenne pepper, cinnamon, and a large pinch of salt. Toss the seeds in the mixture and set aside. In a medium stockpot set over medium heat, heat about a tbsp of oil. Add the onions, carrots, celery, and jalapeno, if using, adn cook, stirring often, until tender, ~10 min. Add the syrup and cook, stirring frequently, until teh syrup is reduced by 2/3. ~5min. Remove the pot from the heat and set aside. When the squash is done, remove it from the oven and allow it to cool briefly. Remoev the flesh from the skin and mix it into the stockpot with the onion mixture. Return the stockpot to the stove over medium heat, add the stock and cream if using. Bring to a simmer and cook for 10 min. Carefully transfer to a blender and blend until smooth. Season with the vinegar and salt. Serve hot with apple, cilantro, and toasted seeds.
