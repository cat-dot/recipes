Heat oil in a 4-5 qt dutch oven over medium heat, until shimmering. Add onion, celery, and a pinch of salt, and sweat until soft, 5-8 min. Add ginger, garlic, carrots, and another pinch of salt to the pot and stir to combine. Cook for 5 min or until the carrots start to take on golden edges. Pour in the stock and increase the heat to medium high to bring to a light boil. Reduce heat back to medium and cover pratially with a lid. Simmer for 20 min, or until carrots are tender and smash readily against side of pot with a fork. Remove the pot from the heat. Use an immersion blender to create a smooth puree.
