Irish Beef Stew
  --Nicole Gaffney

1 tbsp olive oil
2 lbs chuck steak, cubed
salt and pepper to taste
1 tbsp butter
1 large yellow onion, halved and sliced
3 medium carrots, sliced into coins
4 cloves garlic, minced
1 heaping tbsp tomato paste
3 medium red skin potatoes cut into large chunks
2 tsp fresh thyme divided (or 1 tsp dried thyme)
1 bay leaf
16 oz Guiness stout
32 oz beef broth
1 tbsp worcestershire sauce
pinch of sugar
1/4 c fresh parsley finely chopped, divided

Pour olive oil in a large, heavy bottomed pot over high heat. Season the meat with salt and pepper, then add to the pot in a single layer, working in batches if necessary. Allow the meat to brown really well on all sides, ~15 min, then remove from the pan Lower the heat to medium, then add butter, onion, and carrots. Saute for ~5 min, then add garlic and cook for 1 min more. Add the tomato paste and stir until the vegetables are coated. Continue cooking and stirring for ~5 min, then add the potatoes and cook for 2 min more. Add 1 tsp of thyme, the bay leaf, Guiness, beef broth, worcestershire, sugar, and browned meat. Bring up to a boil, then lower the heat all the way and simmer until the stew has thickened slightly and the meat is falling apart, ~2-3 hrs. Taste and adjust the seasoning as needed. Stir in the remaining thyme and half the parsley. Serve and garnish with the remaining parsley.


Notes: can replace beef with lamb. can use slow cooker in place of pot after the browning and sauteing. can use other root vegetables such as turnips, rutabagas, or parsnips along with the carrots and potatoes. can render smoked bacon to cook the beef in for more depth of flavor
