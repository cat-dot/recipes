  --SoupAddict

1 tbsp olive oil
1 medium sweet-tart apple (honecrisp or granny smith) peeled, cored, and chopped
1/2 c chopped onion (~1/2 medium)
1 large leek sliced, white and light green parts only
2 cloves garlic, minced
2 tsp curry powder
1 tsp garam masala
15 oz can pumpkin puree
4 c chicken stock
salt and pepper
1/2 c coconut milk
toasted pepitas for garnish

Heat oil in a 4 or 5 qt dutch oven until shimmering. Add the apple, onions, and leeks, and saute until the onions and leeks are soft and the apples have taken on a golden hue, ~5-7 min. Add the garlic, curry powder, and garam masala, and stir to combine, ~ 30 s. Add pumpkin and stock, and increase the heat to medium high. Bring to a light boil then reduce the heat to medium low and simmer for 15-20 min. Taste and add salt and pepper as needed. Run an immersion blender through the soup, or process in a blender in batches. Stir in the coconut milk and taste again, adjusting seasoning as needed. Ladle into bowls and garnish with pepitas; serves 4.
