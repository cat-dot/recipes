  --Cook's Country

6 oz rustic Italian bread, crusts removed, torn into 1" pieces (~4 c)
1/2 c evoo + extra for serving
10 oz Swiss chard, stems chopped, leaves sliced into 1/2" wide strips
1 onion, chopped
2 carrots, peeled and chopped
1 tsp table salt
3 garlic cloves, minced
1/4 tsp red pepper flakes
28 oz can whole peeled tomatoes, crushed by hand
6 c vegetable broth
15 oz can cannellini beans, rinsed

Adjust oven rack to middle position and heat oven to 425 F. Arrange bread in single layer on rimmed baking sheet and bake, stirring occasionally, until dry and lightly browned, ~10 min. Meanwhile, heat oil in Dutch oven over medium-high heat until shimmering. Add chard stems, onion, carrots, and salt and cook until softened, ~7 min. Stir in garlic and pepper flakes and cook until fragrant, ~30 s. Stir in tomatoes and their juice and cook until slightly thickened, ~2 min. Stir in broth, beans, and chard leaves and bring to simmer. Reduce heat to medium-low; cover; and cook until vegetables are tender, ~10 min. Stir bread into soup. Cover and cook until bread is softened, about 5 minutes. Off heat, whisk soup vigorously until bread is broken down, ~2 min. Season with salt and pepper flakes to taste. Drizzle individual portions with extra oil and serve. Garnish with grated Parmesan cheese, if desired.
