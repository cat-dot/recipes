Lasagna Soup
  --Claire, here's your bite

Ricotta mixture:
1 c parm
1 c ricotta
1 c mozzarella
1/4 c fresh parsley
Salt and pepper to taste

In a medium bowl, combine your parmesan, ricotta, mozzarella, parsley, salt and pepper. Set aside.

Soup:
1-2 tsp Tony’s Seasoning (to taste)
1/2 yellow onion, diced (~1 c)
6-8 cloves minced garlic, to taste
1/2 lb hot or mild Italian sausage (I used hot)
1/2 lb lean ground beef
2 tbsp tomato paste
Salt and pepper to taste
1 tsp dried basil
1 tsp dried parsley
1 tsp dried oregano
1 tsp Italian seasoning
1/2 tsp red pepper (to taste)
24 oz marinara
1/2 c heavy cream
4-6 c chicken stock, depending on how soupy you want it
1/2 lb lasagna noodles, broken into pieces
Handful of fresh basil

In a large soup pot or dutch oven, heat your olive oil over medium heat. Add in your onion, add a pinch of salt, and cook for 4 min.  Throw in your garlic and cook until fragrant, ~30 s. Add in your sausage and beef, breaking into pieces with a wooden spoon. Cook for a few minutes and then season with your salt, pepper, basil, oregano, parsley, Italian, and red pepper. Cook until no longer pink. Add in your tomato paste and stir. Cook for a couple minutes. Pour in your chicken broth and marinara. Bring to a boil. Pour in your lasagna pieces, reduce heat, and  simmer for ~10 min, or until al dente, stirring occasionally. Once your noodles are done, add in your heavy cream and fresh basil (torn). Adjust seasonings if needed. Stir, serve, and top with a dollop of your ricotta mixture. 


Notes: can use full pound of meat; can use any noodles, can use beef or veggie stock
