In a tall sauce pot over medium heat, add the oil and the garlic and saute for 1 min, stirring constantly. Add the onion, salt, and pepper, and cook for 5 min or until tender, stirring occasionally. Add the stock and potato and bring to a boil, stirring to combine. Reduce heat, add cream, and simmer for 10 min. Remove from heat and, using a hand blender, carefully blend the soup until smooth. Adjust seasoning to taste and return to very low heat until serving.
