Thai Pumpkin Soup
  --Vitamix

2 tbsp (30 ml) olive oil
3 c (720 ml) chicken or vegetable broth
1 c (160 g) chopped onion
3/4 c (180 ml) coconut cream
1 tbsp tomato paste
3/4 c (180 ml) coconut milk
2 1/2 c (610 g) canned pumpkin
1 tbsp chopped green chilies
2 tbsp (30 g) chopped fresh ginger
1 tbsp lemon juice
1 garlic clove, peeled, chopped
salt and pepper

Saut√© onion in olive oil until soft. Add tomato paste, pumpkin, ginger, garlic, broth, coconut cream and coconut milk. Combine until thoroughly heated through. Place mixture into blender; add chilies and lemon juice and secure lid. Blend until smooth. Season to taste with salt and pepper.


Notes: as this came from Vitamix, they assume the blender will cook, if using something else, will likely need to pour into a pot and bring to temp.
