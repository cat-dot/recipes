Vegan Mushroom Wild Rice Soup
  --Mega, ShortGirlTallOrder

3/4 c wild rice blend
4 c mushrooms, diced (mix of white button, Crimini, & Shitake)
1 c white onion, diced
2 cloves minced garlic (~1 tbsp)
2 tbsp vegan butter (or oil)
1 tsp dried parsley
5-6 c vegetable broth (start with 5 and add up to 6 for a slightly thinner soup)
14 oz can coconut milk
salt & pepper to taste

Rinse the wild rice and add it to a small or bowl to soak in cold water for 15-30 min. While the rice is soaking, chop & prep the vegetables. Slice the mushrooms thinly (removing the bottom of the stems if desired) and finely dice the onions. Next, add the vegan butter to a large soup pot and turn on the heat. Once the butter has melted, add in the onion, garlic, and mushrooms. Then, saut√© for 15 min until the onions & mushrooms are beginning to crisp up and brown. Make sure to stir consistently to evenly cook the vegetables. Once the vegetables are cooked, season with a mix of parsley, salt, and pepper. Then, add the vegetable broth, soaked & strained wild rice, and coconut milk to the pot with the vegetables. Stir to mix together. Bring the pot of soup to a boil. Then, reduce the heat to a simmer and cook covered for 20 min. At the 20 min mark remove the soup lid, stir the soup, and cook the soup uncovered for an additional 15-20 min until the rice is cooked through. (Please note, if you are using a rice other than wild rice, cooking time will vary, so check if it is done at the 20 min mark). Remove the soup from the heat and let it sit for 5 min to thicken. Finally, serve and enjoy!
