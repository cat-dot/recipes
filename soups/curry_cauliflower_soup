2 cloves garlic unpeeled

1 1/2 c plain greek yogurt

1 tbsp ground cumin
2 1/4 tsp kosher salt
2 tsp freshly ground black pepper

Whisk together the yogurt, lime zest and juice, chili powder, cumin, salt, pepper, garlic powder, and curry pwder in a large bowl. Add the cauliflower and toss to coat. Transfer the cauliflower to the baking sheet with the garlic and shallot. Roast until the cauliflower is lightly browned, 30-40 min. Set aside to cool. When cool enough to handle, squeeze the garlic out from their skins. Place the chicken broth in the blender, followed by the garlic, shallot, and cauliflower. Select the soup setting. Once the cycle finishes, slowly add the cream to the emulsion cup so it blends in while the blender is running. (1 c won't fit all at once so it needs to be added gradually). Select manual/lo, gradually increasing the speed to spped 8 and blend 30-40 s. Season with salt and pepper.
