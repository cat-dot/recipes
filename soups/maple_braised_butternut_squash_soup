Maple Braised Butternut Squash Soup
  --Sur la Table

3 tbsp unsalted butter
4 shallots, coarsely chopped
1 small bulb fennel, peeled and cut into 1/4" chunks
1 garnet yam, peeled and cut into 1" chunks
1 medium butternut squash, peeled, seeded, and cut into 1" chunks
1/3 c pure maple syrup
4 c low-sodium chicken or vegetable broth + more if needed.
4 fresh thyme sprigs + 2 tbsp fresh thyme leaves for garnish
1 dried bay leaf
1/4 tsp freshly grated nutmeg
sea salt and freshly ground black pepper
fresh lemon juice, as needed

To a large Dutch oven set over medium heat, add butter. When butter begins to foam, add shallots and fennel and cook, stirring often until tender, 10-12 min. Add yam, butternut squash, and maple syrup, stirring well to coat. Lastly, add the broth, thyme sprigs, bay leaf, and nutmeg. Bring to a slow simmer. Cook, stirring occasionally, until yams and squash are tender, 20-25 min. Remove soup from heat and discard thyme sprigs and bay leaf. Working in batches, ladle soup into a blender and puree until smooth. Alternatively, puree soup in the Dutch oven using an immersion blender. Return soup to Dutch oven. Taste and adjust seasoning with salt, pepper, and lemon juice. Keep soup warm over low heat. Ladle soup in warmed bowls and top with a dollop of cr√®me fraiche. Sprinkle with thyme leaves and serve warm.
