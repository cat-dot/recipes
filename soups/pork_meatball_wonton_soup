  --Cook's Country
  
1 lb ground pork
4 scallions, white parts minced, green parts sliced thin
1 large egg, lightly beaten
3 1/2 tsp grated fresh ginger, divided
1 tbsp shoyu
1 tbsp toasted sesame oil
1 tbsp chili-garlic sauce, plus extra for serving
1 1/4 tsp table salt, divided
8 c chicken broth
6 heads baby bok choy (4 oz each), halved and cut into 1" pieces
8 oz wonton wrappers, cut into 3/4" wide strips

Combine pork, scallion whites, egg, 1 1/2 tsp ginger, shoyu, sesame oil, chili-garlic sauce, and 1/2 tsp salt in large bowl. Form mixture into 1" meatballs (you should have 30-35 meatballs) and arrange on rimmed baking sheet. (Meatballs can be covered with plastic wrap and refrigerated for up to 24 hr). Bring broth, remaining 2 tsp ginger, and remaining 3/4 tsp salt to boil in large Dutch oven over medium-high heat. Add bok choy and return to boil. Stir in wonton wrappers, 1 handful at a time. Carefully add meatballs to pot; cover; and cook until meatballs are cooked through, 3-5 min. Stir in scallion greens. Season with salt to taste. Serve.
