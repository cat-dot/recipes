Caramelized Gochujang Tomato Soup
  --Justine Doiron

1/4 c evoo
1 medium yellow onion, 12 oz
2 tbsp gochujang, or 3, if you like it spicy
3 garlic cloves, grated
2 tbsp freshly grated ginger
28 oz can of whole tomatoes
2 tbsp shoyu
2 tbsp rice wine vinegar
2 c vegetable stock, or 2 tsp Better than Bouillon vegetable base dissolved in 2 c water
13.5 oz can of full-fat coconut milk + extra for serving

Place a large dutch oven over medium heat, add in the olive oil and let it warm up for a min or so. Add in the onion and cook, stirring occasionally, until slightly softened, 3-4 min. Stir in the gochujang and cook for 10-12 min, or until the gochujang is darker a shade in color, slightly caramelized and the onions are jammy. Add the grated garlic and ginger and cook for 3-4 min or until the garlic no longer smells raw. Add in the tomatoes, shoyu and vinegar. Stir and pour in 2 c of vegetable stock. Use an immersion blender to blend the soup until smooth. Reduce the heat to low, stir in the coconut milk, cover and then simmer for 45 min. After the soup has simmered, taste and season with salt as preferred. To serve, portion into bowls and top with scallions, mint and chili crisp. You can either eat this with white rice or the cheesy scallion pancakes.
