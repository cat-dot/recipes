Creamy Cauliflower Soup
  --GIR

1 head cauliflower, cored and roughly chopped
1 tbsp evoo
2 tbsp butter
1 small onion, chopped
1 large clove of garlic, chopped
1 qt low sodium chicken broth (or homemade)
1/4 c finely grated parmesan
salt to taste
freshly ground black pepper

Heat a large saucepan or medium dutch oven over medium heat. Add the evoo and butter together, and let it melt. Then add the onion and garlic, stirring occasionally for ~5 min, or until the mix softens and becomes translucent. Add the chicken broth and cauliflower and increase heat to high to bring it to a boil. Reduce heat and let it simmer gently. Partially cover and cook until the cauliflower can be easily pierced with a fork, ~13-15 min. Turn off the heat, and puree the soup in batches. Return the soup to the saucepan, stir in the parmesan, and add salt to taste. Add a little bit of freshly ground black pepper, and serve immediately or keep warm until ready.


Notes: Soup can be made a day ahead and stored in refrigerator. Can sub veggie broth to make vegetarian.
