30 Minute Chickpea and Tomato Coconut Curry Soup
  --Nyssa Tanner

Soup:
2 tbsp avocado oil
1 medium sized onion, diced small 
4 cloves of garlic, thinly sliced 
1 tsp salt
1 tbsp curry powder 
pinch of crushed dried chilies (optional – leave out for less spicy)
14.5 oz can of petite diced tomatoes – fire roasted are yummy if you can find them
2x15.5 oz cans of chickpeas, drained and rinsed
13.5 oz can full fat coconut milk 
3 c of broth of choice 
juice of half a lime

Heat the oil over medium heat in a large soup pot. Add the onion, garlic and teaspoon of salt. Saute for ~5-6 min, stirring occasionally, until translucent and soft. Add the curry powder and pinch of dried chili and stir almost constantly for ~30 s or so, until spices are fragrant and start to stick to the bottom of the pan. Add the diced tomatoes and broth. Scrape up any fond from the bottom of the pan. Bring to a boil and then reduce to a simmer. Cover and cook for ~10 min, until tomatoes are soft. Add chickpeas and coconut milk and bring back up to a simmer. Simmer for another 5 min or so to marry the flavors. Season with salt and pepper and juice of half a lime. Makes 4 servings.

Garnish:
fresh lime 
thinly sliced red onion 
cilantro 
roasted cashews – bonus points for curry spiced cashews!

Serve topped with sliced red onion, cilantro, roasted cashews and more lime wedges. 


Notes: can be vegan/vegetarian based on broth of choice
