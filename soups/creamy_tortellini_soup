2 tbsp olive oil
1 lb spicy Italian sausage
1 medium yellow onion, diced
2 garlic cloves, minced
3/4 tsp kosher salt
1/4 tsp freshly cracked pepper
1/4 tsp dried basil
1/4 tsp dried oregano
1/4 tsp dried thyme
2 tbsp tomato paste

3/4 c heavy cream or half and half

Add the olive olive to a large casserole pot set over medium heat. Add the onion and garlic, and cook until soft, ~4 min. Add the italian sausage and cook, breaking it up with a wooden spoon, until browned. Add the tomato paste and cook for 2 min. Sprinkle the flour over the meat and cook until the flour dissolves into the meat, ~1 min. Gradually add the chicken stock, crushed tomatoes, dried spices, 3/4 tsp kosher salt, and 1/4 tsp freshly cracked pepper, and mix to combine. Bring to a boil, then reduce to a gentle simmer. Let simmer for 15 min. Add the tortellini and the heavy cream, and let simmer for 5-7 min, or until the tortellini is cooked. Add spinach, mixing a few times to incorporate it into the soup. Add any additional salt or pepper as needed. Enjoy while hot.
