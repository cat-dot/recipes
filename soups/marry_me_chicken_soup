Marry Me Chicken Soup
  --Robyn Conley Downs 

1 tbsp olive oil
1 medium yellow onion, small diced
1/4 tsp freshly ground pepper
2 1/2 tsp salt, divided
1 tsp granulated garlic powder
1 tsp dried thyme
6 oz can tomato paste
1 qt chicken stock
2 c water
1 tsp sugar
1/2 c sundried tomatoes in oil, chopped
3 c diced or shredded cooked chicken
2 c small-shape pasta (uncooked) such as orecchiette, ditalini, farfalle
1/2 c heavy cream
1/3 c grated parmesan cheese
2 c baby spinach
1 tsp red wine vinegar

Heat a large heavy bottom pot or Dutch oven over medium high heat. Add the olive oil, onion, and 1/4 tsp salt and black pepper. Cook until the onion begins to soften, ~3-5 min, stirring frequently. Sprinkle the onion with the garlic powder and thyme, then cook until fragrant, ~1 min, stirring constantly. Add the tomato paste and cook for 30 s, stirring constantly. Add the chicken stock and 2 c of water, scraping up any browned bits from the bottom of the pan. Add 2 tsp salt,the sugar, sun dried tomatoes, and chicken, stirring to combine. Cover, and bring to a rolling boil. Add the pasta, stirring to ensure the pasta doesn’t stick. Cover, reduce to a strong simmer, and cook until the pasta is just cooked through, ~8-15 min, depending on the pasta shape. Uncover and stir occasionally to prevent the pasta from sticking together or anything sticking to the bottom of the pan. Turn the heat off, uncover, and add the cream, parmesan cheese, vinegar, and spinach, stirring to combine. Taste and adjust seasonings if necessary.


Notes: 1 can of tomato paste is ~10 tbsp. For more protein, use bone broth, maybe add beans (cannellini) can sub full fat coconut milk for cream
