Greens, Orzo, and Meatball Soup
--Deb Perelman, Smitten Kitchen

Meatballs:
1 large egg
2 tbsp water
1/4 c plain dried breadcrumbs
12 oz ground turkey
1/4 c grated parmesan cheese
2 tbsp chopped fresh flat-leaf parsley
2 garlic cloves, minced
3/4 tsp kosher salt
1/4 tsp ground black pepper

Whisk egg and 2 tbsp water in medium bowl to blend. Mix in breadcrumbs; let stand 1 min. Add turkey, parmesan cheese, parsley, garlic, salt, and pepper; gently stir to blend. Using wet hands, shape turkey mixture into 1 1/4" diameter meatballs. Place on baking sheet; chill while you prepare the next steps, or 30 min, if you have the time.

Assembly:
8 c (or more) low-salt chicken broth
1 c chopped peeled carrots
3/4 c (~4.75 oz or 135 g) orzo (rice-shaped pasta)
4 c coarsely chopped escarole (~1/2 medium head), swiss chard, kale or baby spinach (~3 oz of leaves)

Bring chicken broth to a boil in large (4-5 qt) pot. Add carrots and orzo; reduce heat to medium and simmer uncovered 8 min. Add turkey meatballs and simmer 10 min. Stir in chopped greens and simmer until turkey meatballs, orzo, and escarole are tender, ~5 min longer. Season soup to taste with salt and pepper. Ladle soup into bowls and serve.


Notes: Can be made ahead 2 hrs, just reheat.
