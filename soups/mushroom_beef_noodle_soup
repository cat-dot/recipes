Mushroom Beef Noodle Soup
  --Joyce Hendley, M.S.

1/2 oz dried porcini mushrooms
1 c boiling water
2 tsp canola oil
1 1/2 c chopped celery
1  1/2 c chopped carrots
3 cloves garlic, minced
1 lb cremini mushrooms, chopped
1 1/2 c chopped onion 
1 lb boneless sirloin or flank steak, trimmed, cut into 1/2" cubes
2 tbsp tomato paste
1/2 c dry red wine
1 tbsp Worcestershire sauce 
6 cups reduced-sodium beef broth
1 large turnip, peeled and cut into 1/4-inch dice
1 bay leaf
1/2 tsp dried thyme
1/2 tsp freshly ground pepper
1/4 tsp salt
2 c whole-wheat egg noodles, cooked
1/2 c chopped fresh parsley or dill for garnish

Place porcini in a bowl; add boiling water and soak for 10 min to soften. Line a sieve with a paper towel, place over a bowl and strain, reserving the liquid; finely chop the porcini and set aside. Heat oil in a soup pot or Dutch oven over medium heat. Cook celery, carrots and garlic, stirring frequently, until softened, 6-8 min. Transfer to a bowl. Add cremini and onion; cook over medium-high heat, stirring, until browned, 8-10 min. Transfer to the bowl. Add steak to the pot and cook on medium-high, stirring occasionally, until beginning to brown, 3-5 min; add tomato paste and cook, stirring, for 30 s. Add wine and Worcestershire and cook until the sauce thickens slightly, ~30 s. Stir in the porcini and liquid, reserved vegetables, broth, turnip, bay leaf, thyme, pepper and salt; cover and bring to a boil. Reduce heat and simmer, covered, until the vegetables are tender, 25-30 min. Discard the bay leaf. Stir in noodles. Garnish with herbs, if desired.
