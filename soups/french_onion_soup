French Onion Soup

2 lbs sweet white onions (ex. vidalia) halved and thinly sliced (2 large onions)
3/4 lb shallots, thinly sliced (8-10 small)
2 thyme sprigs
1 garlic clove, smashed
1 bay leaf
3 tbsp unsalted butter
3/4 tsp kosher salt + more to taste
8 c low sodium beef broth
freshly ground black pepper to taste
1 large baguette, cut into 1/2" thick slices
8 oz grueyere cheese thinly sliced or grated

In a slow cooker, combine the onion, shallots, thyme, garlic, bay leaf, and butter, and season with salt. Turn the slow cooker on high and cook until the onions are very soft and the garlic has disintegrated, 3hrs. Add the beef broth, season with a pinch of black pepper and continue to cook on high for 2 hrs more. Makes ~ 10c.

For serving:
30 min prior to serving, adjust the oven rack to the top portion and preheat the oven to 425F. On a foil lined baking sheet, arrange 8-12 bread slices in a single layer and toast until light golden brown, 5 min. Set aside and increase the oven temp to the low broil setting. On the baking sheet, place 4-6 oven safe bowls and fill each to the rim with soup. Top with 1-2 slices of toasted bread and layer with cheese, completely covering the bread. Broil in the oven until the cheese is melted, 2-3 min. Serve with any extra bread for dipping.
