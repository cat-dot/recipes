  --Beth Sachs

2 tbsp Butter
1 Onion - finely chopped
2 Carrots - diced
2 ribs Celery - sliced
2 cloves Garlic - crushed
10 oz Mushrooms - sliced (around 2 ¼ cups)
3 cups Leftover Roast Beef - cut into bite sized pieces
5 cups Beef Stock - gluten free if required
1 tbsp Tomato Ketchup
1 tsp Worcestershire Sauce
1 cup Wild Rice - rinse well in a sieve under running water
½ cup Heavy Cream
1 tbsp Parsley - chopped, optional garnish

Melt the butter over a medium low heat. in a large Dutch Oven or heavy bottomed saucepan with a lid. Fry the onion, celery and carrots in the butter until soft. This should take around 10 min. Season well and add the sliced mushrooms. Saute for a further 5 min, stirring occasionally. Stir in the crushed garlic. Add the cut up leftover roast beef and stir gently. Add the beef stock, as well as the tomato ketchup and Worcestershire sauce. Stir to incorporate. Add the rinsed wild rice. Bring the soup to a boil then turn down to a simmer. Add the lid and simmer for around 40 minutes, stirring occasionally, until the rice is cooked. Taste and adjust seasoning as desired. Stir in the heavy cream. Serve sprinkled with parsley if using.


Note:If you prefer your soup a little thinner, add some more stock instead of/in addition to the cream. Can use tomato paste instead of ketchup. Can add a splash of sherry at the end (or sherry vinegar)
