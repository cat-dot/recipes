Preheat oven to 450F. Combine coriander, cumin, cinnamon, turmeric, salt, pepper and cayenne in a small bowl. Toss cauliflower with 1 tbsp oil in a large bowl, sprinkle with 1 tbsp of the spice mixture and toss again. Spread in a single layer on a rimmed baking sheet. Roast the cauliflower until the edges are browned, 15-20 min. Set aside. Meanwhile, heat the remaining 1 tbsp oil in a large pot over medium-high heat. Add onion and carrot and cook, stirring often, until starting to brown, 3-4 min. Reduce heat to medium and continue cooking, stirring often, until the onion is soft, 3-4 min. Add garlic, ginger, chile and the remaining spice mixture. Cook, stirring, for 1 min more. Stir in tomato sauce, scraping up any browned bits, and simmer for 1 min. Add broth, potatoes, sweet potatoes, lime zest and juice. Cover and bring to a boil over high heat. Reduce heat to maintain a gentle simmer and cook, partially covered and stirring occasionally, until the vegetables are tender, 35-40 min. Stir in coconut milk and the roasted cauliflower. Return to a simmer to heat through. Serve garnished with cilantro and chiles, if desired.
