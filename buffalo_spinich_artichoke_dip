Buffalo Spinish Artichoke Dip

3 slices (5 oz) thick-cut bacon
3 garlic cloves, minced
½ medium yellow onion, finely chopped
9 oz frozen artichoke hearts, thawed and finely chopped
6 c baby spinach, roughly chopped
8 oz cream cheese, softened
4 oz smoked blue cheese, softened
1½ c grated Parmesan, divided
½ c sour cream
6 tbsp hot sauce
Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper, to taste
½ c panko bread crumbs
1 tbsp olive oil

Preheat oven to 400F. In a large skillet, heat the bacon over medium-high heat. Cook, turning as needed, until the bacon is golden and the fat has rendered, 8-10 min. Transfer the bacon to a paper towel-lined plate to drain, then finely chop and set aside. Add the garlic and onions to the pan and cook, stirring often, until golden, 8-10 min. Add the artichoke hearts and spinach, and cook until the spinach is lightly wilted, 2-3 min. Meanwhile, in a large bowl, stir the cream cheese, blue cheese, 1 c of the parmesan, sour cream and hot sauce until smooth. Fold in the spinach and artichoke mixture. Season with salt and pepper. Transfer to a 1 1/2 qt casserole dish and smooth the top with a rubber spatula. In a small bowl, mix the remaining 1/2 c parmesan with the reserved bacon, panko and olive oil. Sprinkle the bread crumb topping over the dip and place the casserole dish on a sheet pan in case any cheese bubbles over. Bake until golden brown and bubbling, 25-30 min, then serve.

Notes: Can be made a day in advance, everything up to putting in the oven for final bake.
