Bake Stuffed Shells with Squash and Burrata

1 medium butternut squash, halved lengthwise and seeded
2 tsp olive oil
1/2 tsp kosher salt + more to taste
12oz package jumbo pasta shells
1 c whole milk ricotta cheese, divided
1 c grated parmesan cheese, divided
1 egg, lightly beaten
1 large garlic clove, finely chopped and smashed
3 tbsp chopped flat leaf parsley
4 tsp fresh lemon juice (juice of 1/2 lemon)
2 tsp finely grated lemon zest
2 tsp chopped fresh oregano
2x8oz or 4x4oz burrata balls


Preheat the oven to 400F and line a sheet tray with parchment paper. Place the squash onto the prepared sheet tray and season the flesh with the olive oil and salt. Turn them so that they are cut side down and roast until tender, 35-40 min. Let cool for 7-10 min, then scoop the flesh into a medium bowl and set aside.  Yields about 3 c. Can be made ahead and stored in fridge for up to 2 days. Lower the oven to 375F. Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil. Add the jumbo shells and cook until barely al dente, 9 min. Drain the pasta and rinse under cold running water for 1 min. In a large bowl, combine the ricotta, 3/4 c of the parmesan, the egg, garlic, parsley, lemon juice and zest, oregano, and cooled roasted squash. Taste and adjust the seasoning with salt. Fill each cooked shell with 1 1/2 tbsp of the filling and snuggle the shells into a 9x13" baking dish. Tear the burrata over the pasta, letting the curds and cream call over and around the shells. Top with remaining parmesan and bake until goledn brown and bubbling, 30 min.
