Vanilla Ice Cream

2 c heavy cream
2 c half and half (or 1 c heavy cream + 1 c whole milk)
1/2 vanilla bean, split lengthwise and seeds scraped out, or 3 tbsp loose earl grey tea + 1 tsp vanilla
1 c granulated sugar or 3/4 c light corn syrup
1/2 tsp salt 

In a saucepan or microwave safe container, combine cream, half and half, and vanilla bean and seeds (or tea and vanilla). On the stove or in the microwave, bring mixture to a simmer. Immediately turn off heat. Add sugar (or corn syrup) and sal and mix until sugar dissolves, ~1min. Taste and add more sugar and salt as needed to balance the flavors. The mixture should taste slightly too sweet when warm; the sweetness will be muted when frozen. Strain mixture into a container and refrigerate until very cold, at least 4 hrs and preferably overnight. Churn in an ice cream maker according to manufacture's instructions.
