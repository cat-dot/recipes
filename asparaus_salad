Asparagus Salad with Oranges, Feta, and Hazelnuts
  --Cook's Country

Pesto:
2 c fresh mint leaves
1/4 c fresh basil leaf
1/4 c grated Pecorino Romano cheese
1 tsp grated lemon zest + 2 tsp juice
1 garlic clove, minced
Salt and pepper
1/2 c evoo

Process mint, basil, Pecorino, lemon zest and juice, garlic, and 3/4 tsp salt in food processor until finely chopped, ~20 s, scraping down bowl as needed. Transfer to large bowl. Stir in oil until combined and season with salt and pepper to taste.

Salad:
2 lb asparagus, trimmed
2 large oranges
4 oz feta cheese, crumbled (1 c)
3/4 c blanched hazelnuts, toasted and chopped
salt and pepper

Cut asparagus tips from stalks into 3/4" long pieces. Slice asparagus stalks 1/" thick on bias into ~2" lengths. Cut away peel and pith from oranges. Holding fruit over bowl, use paring knife to slice between membranes to release segments. Add asparagus tips and stalks, orange segments, feta, and hazelnuts to pesto and toss to combine. Season with salt and pepper to taste. Serve.


Notes: Parmesan can be substituted for the Pecorino Romano. Grate the cheese for the pesto with a rasp-style grater or use the small holes of a box grater; shave the cheese for the salad with a vegetable peeler. For easier slicing, select large asparagus spears, ~1/2" thick.
