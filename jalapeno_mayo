Candied Jalapeno Mayo
 -Christine Cikowski and Josh Kulp
 
½ c granulated sugar
½ c water
2 medium jalapeños, stemmed and cut into ¼" rounds
2 medium Fresnos, stemmed and cut into ¼" rounds
1 c mayonnaise
Kosher salt, to taste

In a small saucepan, bring the sugar, water, jalapeños and Fresnos to a boil over medium-high heat. Once boiling, reduce the heat to a simmer and cook until the peppers have softened and are saturated with the syrup, 15-20 min. Remove from the heat and let cool completely in the syrup. Using a slotted spoon, transfer the peppers to a mini food processor and pulse until the mixture is finely chopped. Transfer to a small bowl and whisk in the mayo. Season with salt, then use right away or store in an airtight container in the refrigerator for up to 2 weeks.
