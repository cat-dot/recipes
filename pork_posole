1 c ap flour
1/2 tbsp kosher salt + more to taste
1/2 tbsp freshly ground black pepper
1 tsp groun cumin
3 lbs pork shoulder, cut into 3" pieces
3 tbsp lard, divided
3 tbsp olive oil, divided
4 garlic cloves, minced
1 yellow onion, finely chopped
4 c water
1 1/2 tbsp minced oregano
3/4 tbsp cumin seeds, toasted
2 bay leaves
1 1/2 c fresh corn kernels
1 lb (6 medium) tomatillos
2 1/4 c canned hominy, rinsed
1 c roasted red peppers, diced
1 jalapeno, stemmed, seeded, and minced
crumbeld cotija cheese for garnish
cilantro leaves for garnish

Preheat oven to 350F. In a large bowl, whisk together the flour, salt, pepper, and cumin. Toss the pork in the flour to dredge, shaking off any excess. In a 6 quart dutch oven, heat 1 1/2 tbsp of lard and 2 tbsp of oil over medium heat. Working in 2 batches, sear the pork, turning as needed until golden brown, 7-10 min per batch. Watch the pork carefully to make sure any excess flour in the pan doesn't burn. Once seared, transfer to a plate lined with paper towels. To the pot, add the remaining lard, garlic, and onions. Cook until translucent, 2-3 min. Return the pork to the pan with the water, oregano, cumin seeds, and bay leaves. Bring to a boil, then reduce to a very low simmer and cook, covered over low heat until the pork is tender, 2 hrs. Meanwhile, on a baking sheet toss the corn with the remaining 1 tbsp of oil. Bake until golden brown, 23-14 min, then set aside. Once pork has simmered for 2 hrs, add the roasted corn, tomatillos, hominy, roasted red peppers, and jalapeno. Return to a low simmer and cook, covered, until the pork begins to fall apart, 1 hr. Using 2 forks, shred the pork into bit site pieces. Ladle the posole into bowls and garnish with the cheese and cilantro leaves, then serve.
