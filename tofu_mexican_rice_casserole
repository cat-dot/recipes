  --Joy Shull

8 oz sliced mushrooms
1 red bell pepper, diced
1 medium onion, diced
12 cloves of garlic, minced
14 oz extra firm tofu, drained
3 tbsp olive oil, divided
5 c cooked white rice
16 oz enchilada sauce
Juice of 2 small limes
1/4 c chopped cilantro
3 tbsp cumin
1 tbsp chili powder
1 tsp pepper
1 1/2 tsp sea salt
2/3 c shredded Mexican cheese for filling
1/2 c shredded Mexican cheese, for topping

Cook rice according to instructions. You will need 5 c of cooked rice (I used a rice cooker). Add mushrooms, bell pepper, onion, garlic, and 1 tbsp of olive oil to a large skillet. Saute on medium high heat for 10-15 min, or until mushrooms cook down. After you get the veggies started, drain tofu and pat dry with a paper towel. Heat a large skillet over medium high with 2 tbsp of olive oil. Add the block of tofu and use a potato masher to scramble into egg like texture. Cook tofu for around 10 minutes, using a spatula to press down and scramble until it starts to dry out and get browned. Once veggies have cooked, add the tofu, enchilada sauce, cooked rice, lime juice, cilantro, cumin, chili powder, pepper, salt, and 2/3 c of shredded mexican cheese. tir well to combine and taste/adjust seasonings if desired. Transfer mixture to a casserole dish and spread out evenly. Sprinkle on remaining 1/2 c of mexican cheese on top. Bake at 400F for 15 min, or until cheese is bubbly and edges begin to brown. Serve garnished with additional cilantro, sour cream, and tortilla chips.
