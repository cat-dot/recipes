Sweet Potato Casserole with Coconut
  --Charlyne Mattox

3 lb sweet potatoes, peeled and cut into 1" pieces
kosher salt
1 c sweetened shredded coconut
1/2 c packed light brown sugar
1/2 c chopped pecans
1/2 c sugar
1/3 c whole milk
1/2 c (1 stick) unsalted butter, cut into pieces
3 large eggs
1 tsp vanilla

Place the potatoes in a large pot and add enough cold water to cover. Bring to a boil and add 2 tsp salt. Reduce heat and simmer until very tender, 20-25 min. Drain the potatoes and return them to the pot. Meanwhile, heat oven to 325F. In a small bowl, combine the coconut, brown sugar, pecans, and 1/2 tsp salt. Add the granulated sugar, milk, butter, eggs, vanilla, and 1/2 tsp salt to the potatoes and mash until smooth. Transfer the mixture to an 8" square or another shallow 2 qt baking dish and sprinkle with the coconut mixture. Bake until heated through (tent loosely with foil if the top browns too quickly), 30-35 min.
