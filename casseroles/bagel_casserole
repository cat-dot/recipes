Mix eggs, milk, salt, and pepper in a large bowl. Grease  large casserole dish with butter. Spread 1/2 of the bagels evenly on the bottom of the dish. Take 1/2 of the cream cheese and place pieces on top of the bagels. Scatter 1/2 of the scallions onto the casserole followed by 1/2 c bacon. Repeat with remaining bagels, cream cheese, scallions, and bacon. Pour the egg mixture over, soaking the entire casserole. Cover and place in the refrigerator overnight.
