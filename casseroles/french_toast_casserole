  --Cook's Country

1 tbsp unsalted butter, softened, + 6 tbsp unsalted butter, melted
3/4 c packed (5 1/4 oz) brown sugar
1 tbsp ground cinnamon
1/2 tsp ground nutmeg
1/8 tsp salt
18 slices potato sandwich bread
2 1/2 cu whole milk
6 large eggs
1/4 c sliced almonds, toasted
Confectioners' sugar

Adjust oven rack to middle position and heat oven to 350F. Grease 13x9" baking dish with softened butter. Mix brown sugar, cinnamon, nutmeg, and salt together in bowl. Sprinkle 3 tbsp brown sugar mixture evenly over bottom of prepared dish. Place 6 bread slices (use bread heels here) in even layer in bottom of dish. Brush bread with 1 1/2 tbsp melted butter and sprinkle with 3 tbsp sugar mixture. Place 6 bread slices in single layer over first layer, brush with 1 1/2 tbsp melted butter, then sprinkle with 3 tbsp sugar mixture. Place remaining 6 bread slices over previous layer and brush with 1 1/2 tbsp melted butter. In separate bowl, whisk milk and eggs together until well combined. Pour milk mixture over bread and press lightly to submerge. Sprinkle with almonds and remaining heaping 3 tbsp sugar mixture. Bake until casserole is slightly puffed and golden brown and bubbling around edges, ~30 min. Transfer casserole to wire rack, brush with remaining 1 1/2 tbsp melted butter, and let cool for 15 minutes. Sprinkle with confectionersâ€™ sugar and serve. 


Notes: The assembled casserole, minus almonds and remaining heaping 3 tablespoons sugar mixture, can be covered and refrigerated for up to 12 hr. When ready to cook, sprinkle with almonds and sugar mixture and bake as directed.
