1 lb (85% lean) ground beef

Reduce heat to medium. Add onion and garlic and cook, stirring, until onion is translucent, 4-5 min. Add tomato sauce, soup, cream, and one-third of cheese. Bring to a simmer and cook, adding 1/2 - 1 c pasta water, until cheese is melted and desired consistency is reached, ~1 min; season with salt, if needed. Add noodles to pot and mix with meat mixture. Pour into 13x9" baking pan and sprinkle with remaining cheese. Bake casserole until center and edges are bubbly, 30 min. Top with parsley.
