Spinach and Artichoke Quinoa Casserole
  --Marianne Williams
  
1 c cashew or almond milk
1/2 c + 2 tbsp. unsweetened cashew butter
2 tbsp rice vinegar
2 tbsp white miso
1/4 c nutritional yeast, divided
3 tbsp olive oil, divided
1 1/2 tsp kosher salt, divided
Cooking spray
16 oz frozen chopped spinach, thawed and well drained
2 c cooked quinoa
1 c coarsely chopped marinated artichoke hearts (from a 12 oz jar), drained
1 c coarsely crushed kettle-cooked potato chips (~1 1/2 oz)

Add milk, cashew butter, vinegar, miso, 3 tbsp nutritional yeast, 2 tbsp oil, and 1/2 tsp salt to a blender. Blend until completely smooth, ~1 min. (Cashew cream can be prepared and refrigerated in an airtight container up to 2 days in advance.) Preheat oven to 375Â°F with 1 rack in center of oven and 1 rack 6 inches from heat. Coat a 9" square (or 6-8 c) broiler-safe baking dish with cooking spray. Place cashew cream, spinach, quinoa, artichokes, and remaining 1 tsp salt in a large bowl; fold to combine. Transfer mixture to baking dish. Bake on center rack until heated through and set, ~20 min. Meanwhile, combine chips and remaining 1 tbsp each nutritional yeast and oil in a medium bowl. Top casserole with chip mixture. Place on top rack and increase oven temperature to broil. Broil until chips are golden brown, 1-2 min. Let cool for 5 min before serving.
