Beef & Mushroom Country Casserole
  --Beth Moncel
  
1 tbsp cooking oil
1/2 lb ground beef
8 oz mushrooms
1 onion
1/4 tsp garlic powder
1/4 tsp salt
freshly cracked pepper
1/2 tbsp worcestershire sauce
8 oz extra wide egg noodles
15 oz can tomato sauce
12 oz can fire roasted diced tomatoes, drained
8 oz sour cream
8 oz medium cheddar, shredded
4 green onions. sliced

Cook the noodles according to the package directions, but until slightly less done. The noodles will further cook while the casserole bakes. Once cooked, drain the noodles and set it aside. While the noodles are cooking, finely dice the onion and slice the mushrooms. Add the oil and ground beef to a large skillet. Cook over medium heat until the beef is fully browned. If using a higher fat content beef, drain off the excess fat before continuing. Add the onion, mushrooms, garlic powder, salt, and some pepper to the skillet. Continue to saute over medium heat until the musrooms are soft and the onions are transparent. Add the tomato sauce and Worcestershire sauce to the beef mixture. Stir to combine, then simmer for a few minutes, or until it thickens slightly. Preheat oven to 350F. Return the drained noodles to the pot they were boiled in (heat turned off) and add the beef mixture, diced tomatoes, sour cream, half of the cheese, and half of the green onion. Stir to combine and then transfer to a 9x13" casserole dish. Top the casserole with the remaining cheese, then bake for 30 min, or until it is bubbling around the edgesand the top is starting to brown just slightly. After removing from the oven, sprinkle remaining green onions over top.



Notes: recipe is pretty forgiving for substitues (beans for beef, etc) Can use 1 lb beef if desired. Made with 1lb beef and 24oz mushrooms, ratio seemed fine
