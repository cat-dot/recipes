Baked Spinach Casserole
  --Nicole, Cooking for Keeps

1 lb frozen spinach
1 large egg
1/4 tsp kosher salt
1/2 c cottage cheese
1/2 tsp ground nutmeg
1/2 c shredded low-fat sharp cheese
2 tbsp plain breadcrumbs
1 large garlic clove, grated

Preheat oven to 375F. Grease a 9" oval baking dish or equivilant with non-stick cooking spray. Defrost spinach in the microwave or under warm water. Use your hands to squeeze out all the excess moisture in the spinach. Add to a medium mixing bowl. Add remaining ingredients to the spinach. Mix until combined. Pour into prepared baking dish and bake 30 min or until hot and bubbly.



Notes: Swap out your favorite cheese for cheddar. Parmesan or gruyere would be great. Because there’s only a half cup, even full-fat cheese won’t add a lot of fat and calories to each serving.
