Baked Chinese Chicken and Rice
  --Nagi

Chicken & marinade:
1 lb skinless boneless chicken thighs halved
1 tbsp soy sauce
2 tbsp Chinese cooking wine or Mirin or dry sherry
1/4 c oyster sauce
1 tsp sesame oil
1 garlic clove minced

Mix Chicken and Marinade in a bowl. Set aside for at least 20 min, up to 24 hr.

Rice:
1 1/2 c uncooked white rice
2 tbsp vegetable oil
4 green onions whites only
2 garlic cloves minced
2 cups frozen diced vegetables thawed
1 tbsp dark soy sauce
2 tbsp Chinese cooking wine or dry sherry or Mirin or cooking sake
1 1/2 c chicken or vegetable stock or chicken broth (low sodium)
1 1/2 c hot water

Preheat oven to 350F/180C. Place  oil, soy sauce, cooking  wine, stock, and water, in a medium pot and bring to a boil. Pour liquid into a 9x13" pan and add the rice and vegetables spreading them out evenly. Remove chicken pieces from the marinade (reserving marinade) and place on top - chicken will be partially submerged in the liquid. Cover with foil and bake for 15 min. Remove foil, baste the chicken with remaining Marinade (dab it on generously), spray chicken with oil then bake for a further 20 min until chicken is caramalized, the liquid is absorbed and rice is fluffy. If you want more caramelization on the chicken, flick the broiler on for a few min. Set aside for 10 min before fluffing rice then serving, garnished with scallions if using.



Notes: if you use brown rice, cook the rice in the liquid for ~55 min, then add veggies and chicken and continue on.
