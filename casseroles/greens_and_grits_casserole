Green and Grits Casserole
  --Rosalynn Daniels

Grits:
1 c quick grits
4 c Chicken, turkey, or vegetable broth
3 tbsp butter
2 c cheddar cheese, shredded
1 c parmesan, shredded
2 c smoked gouda, divided
1 c heavy whipping cream
3 tbsp hot sauce
1 tsp black pepper
1 tsp onion powder
1 tsp garlic powder
1 tsp salt

Preheat the oven to 350F. In a large saucepan, bring the broth to a boil. Add the grits and stir well. Reduce the heat to low and cover the pan, allowing the grits to cook for 5-7 min or until they are tender. Stir frequently to prevent clumping. Add the butter, cheddar cheese, parmesan cheese, half of the smoked gouda cheese, heavy cream, hot sauce, black pepper, garlic powder, and salt to the grits. Stir until the cheese has melted and all of the ingredients are well combined. Adjust the seasoning to taste.

Collard Greens:
2-3 cups of collard Greens
1 c shredded turkey or rotisserie (optional)
1/2-1 c chopped cooked bacon

In a separate pan, add the collard greens and cook them for several minutes until they are just wilted. Drain off any excess liquid and set the greens aside. Or use leftover Collard Greens. Add the cooked greens to the grits and mix well. Pour the grits and greens mixture into a casserole dish and spread it out evenly. Top the casserole with the remaining smoked gouda cheese and chopped bacon. Bake the casserole for 15-20 min or until the cheese on top is melted and bubbly. Remove the casserole from the oven and allow it to cool for a few minutes before serving.
