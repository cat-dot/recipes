Baked Vodka Sauce Gnocchi eith Burrata
  --Jessica Merchant
  
1 c reserved pasta water, or substitution**
2 tbsp unsalted butter
1 shallot, diced
4 garlic cloves, minced
kosher salt and pepper
1/2 c tomato paste
3 tbsp vodka, (I like Titoâ€™s)
1/3 c heavy cream
1/3 finely grated parmesan cheese + more for topping
2 lb uncooked gnocchi
8 oz burrata cheese, pulled apart
fresh basil, for topping

**To make a starchy pasta water without cooking pasta, combine 1 c of water with 1/2 tsp of cornstarch and 1/4 tsp salt. Bring it to a boil in a saucepan, then turn off the heat.

Preheat oven to 400F. Heat the butter in a 10-12" oven-safe saucepan or skillet over medium heat. Once melted, stir in the shallots and garlic with a big pinch of salt and pepper. Cook, stirring often, until the onions soften. Add in the tomato paste and stir, cooking for 5 min. The color will darken - this is where the flavor is! Stream in the vodka and stir, scraping the brown bits and flavor from the bottom. Stir in 1/2 c of the reserved (or makeshift) pasta water. Stir in the heavy cream and parmesan, stirring until the cheese melts. Taste and season the sauce with more salt and pepper if needed. Stir in the uncooked gnocchi. Pull apart the burrata cheese and place it all over the gnocchi. Sprinkle with parmesan. Bake for 15-20 min, until the cheese is melty and bubbly. Serve, topped with parmesan and fresh basil.
