1/2 tsp black pepper, divided
1 tbsp ground cumin
2 tsp chili powder

3 medium green onions, thinly sliced

Fill a large saucepan about 2/3 full with water and bring to a boil. Add chicken and as soon as water starts to bubble again, cover and reduce heat to medium low. Water should cover chicken by ~1". Cook at a low simmer until chicken is no longer pink in the thickest part and registeres 165F on an instant read thermometer, 22-25 min. Wehn cool enough to handle, pull chicken off bones and tear into bite sized pieces. Set aside. (can do this up to 2 days in advance) Preheat oven to 350F. In a large skillet on medium high, heat oil. Add onion, bell pepper, 1/8 tsp salt and 1/4 tsp pepper. Cook for 12-15 min, stirring occasionally, until soft and lightly browned. Add cumin, chile powder, and oregano, and stir to combine. Add garlic and jalapeno, and cook until garlic softens, stirring frequently, ~1 min. Add tomatoes, and bring to a simmer. Stir in corn and cook until heated through, ~1 min. Reduce heat to medium low. In a small bowl stir together about 2 tbsp milk and potato starch until combined; stir in remaining milk. Add to skillet and bring to a simmer, stirring constantly until slightly thickened, ~1 min. Stir in chicken and cook until heated through, ~1 min. Season with remaining 1/2 tsp salt and 1/4 tsp pepper. Remove from heat. Coat a 9x13" baking dish with cooking spray. Arrange half of tortillas over bottom of dish, overlapping slightly. Top with half of the chicken mixture, then sprinkle with half the cheese. Add a second layer of tortillas, chicken, and cheese. Cover with foil and bake until liquid is bubbling and cheese is melted, 35-45 min. Rest for 5 min. Sprinkle with green onions.
