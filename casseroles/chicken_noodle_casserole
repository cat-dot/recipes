  --Diabetic Living Magazine

4 stalks celery, chopped (2 c)
1 medium onion, chopped (1/2 c) 
2 tsp canola oil
2 lb chicken legs and/or thighs, skinned
1/2 tsp black pepper
1 tsp dried thyme, crushed
3/4 tsp salt
6 c water
1 slice bread
10 oz jumbo or extra-large egg noodles
8 oz carton light sour cream
2 tbsp flour 
1/2 tsp garlic powder
nonstick cooking spray
2 tbsp snipped fresh parsley

Preheat oven to 375F. In a Dutch oven cook two-thirds of the celery and onion in hot oil over medium heat for 3 min. Add chicken, pepper, thyme and salt to Dutch oven; cook for 2 minutes. Add the water. Bring to boiling; reduce heat. Simmer, covered, for 20-25 min until chicken is no longer pink. Meanwhile, for topping, tear bread in small pieces. Finely chop remaining celery and onion. In a small bowl toss together the bread, celery and onion; set aside. Using a slotted spoon, transfer chicken to a cutting board to cool slightly. Add noodles to simmering broth in Dutch oven; boil gently for 7-8 min, just until tender, stirring occasionally. With a slotted spoon transfer noodles, celery and onion to a 3-quart baking dish. For sauce, in a bowl whisk together sour cream, flour and garlic powder. Gradually whisk in 1 c of the hot broth until smooth. Add sour cream mixture to broth in Dutch oven; cook and stir until boiling. Meanwhile, remove chicken from bones; discard bones. Chop chicken and add to noodles in baking dish. Gently stir in sauce. Sprinkle with bread topping, then lightly coat with cooking spray. Bake, uncovered, for 30-35 min or until casserole is heated through and topping begins to brown. Top with parsley just before serving.
