One Pan Lasagna
  --Scanpan

1 lb ground meat or mushrooms of your choice
1 medium yellow onion, diced
2 celery stalks, diced
1 large carrot, diced
3 garlic cloves, minced
3 tbsp tomato paste
1/2 c red wine
28 oz can crushed tomatoes
1 1/4 c vegetable broth
3 tbsp chopped fresh herbs such as thyme, rosemary, parsley and oregano, divided
1 lb fresh lasagna noodles (homemade or store-bought)
1 c shredded mozzarella
1 c ricotta cheese
olive oil, as needed
kosher salt, to taste
fresh ground black pepper, to taste
freshly grated parmesan cheese, for topping

Place the 4qt Dutch oven over medium-high heat with 1/2 tbsp of oil (more if you are using mushrooms). Place the ground meat or mushrooms in the pan and saut√© until browned, ~5 min. Transfer to a plate and return the pan to the heat. Pour in ~1 tbsp of oil followed by the onion, celery and carrot. Cook until the onions are translucent, stirring occasionally, then add the garlic and tomato paste. Stir continuously until the tomato paste coats the vegetables and the garlic is aromatic. Deglaze the pan with the red wine, using the spoon or spatula to scrape the bottom of the pan. Once the wine has been reduced by half stir in the crushed tomatoes, vegetable broth and 2 tbsp of herbs. Bring to a boil and cook until reduced, ~10 min. Taste and season with salt and pepper as needed before pouring most of the sauce into a medium bowl, leaving a layer of sauce in the bottom of the pan. In a small bowl stir the remaining 1 tbsp of herbs into the ricotta cheese. Arrange a layer of lasagna noodles over the sauce, top with a layer of ground meat, sauce, mozzarella and ricotta cheeses. Repeat until all of the noodles have been used. Cover and return the pan to medium heat, cooking for 5-6 min. Alternatively, you can leave this uncovered and bake it in a 375F oven for 10 min. Allow the lasagna to sit for 5 minutes before topping with freshly grated parmesan cheese and serving.
