Chile Relleno Breakfast Casserole
  --John Lewis and Ray England

1 3/4 lbs (12 medium) poblano chiles
1 1/2 c half and half
2 tbsp ap flour
1 tbsp kosher salt
8 eggs
1 garlic clove
nonstick cooking spray
2 c grated monterey jack cheese
boiling water, for baking

Preheat broiler to high and line a sheet pan with foil. Line the chiles next to each other on the pan and broil, tuning as needed, until the chiles are well charred, 4-5 min. Transfer to a heatproof bowl and cover with plastic wrap. Let steam for 15 min, then peel and deseed the poblanos using the back of a knife. Lower oven temp to 300F. In a blender, combine the half and half, flour, salt, eggs, and garlic. Blend on medium until smooth. Grease a 9x13" baking dish with cooking spray and line with a quarter of the poblanos, followed by a quarter of the grated cheese. Continue the layering until all the chiles and cheese have been used. Pour the egg mixture to cover. Place the baking dish in a roasting pan and fill the pan with enough boiling water to come up halfway along the sides of the baking dish. Bake until eggs begin to set, 30 min, then raise the temp to 400F and bake for another 10-15 min, until eggs are fully cooked and top is golden brown. Let rest at room temp for 15 min, then slice and serve.
