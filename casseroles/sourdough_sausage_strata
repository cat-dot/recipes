Sourdough Sausage Strata
  --McKenna Pulda 
  
8 c sourdough bread, 1" cubes
1 lb pork sausage
1 package frozen spinach, thawed and drained
1 yellow onion, diced, about 1 1/2 cups
3 cloves garlic, minced
1 1/2 c Gruyere cheese, shredded
1/2 c Parmesan cheese, shredded
10 large eggs
2 3/4 c half and half
2 tbsp dijon mustard
1 tsp thyme
1 1/2 tsp salt
1/2 tsp black pepper

Heat a large skillet to medium heat. Cook pork sausage until cooked through. Remove the breakfast sausage from the skillet. Sauté onion in the remaining oil for 5-7 min, until translucent and soft. You may need to add extra oil. Add spinach and garlic. Saute for 2-3 min, or until the garlic is fragrant. In a small bowl, mix the grated cheese; set aside. Place half of the sourdough cubes (4 c) in a greased 12" cast iron skillet. Top with half the sautéed spinach mixture, half the cooked sausage, and then half of the grated cheese. Repeat with the layering, ending with the remaining cheese on the top of the strata. In a large bowl, whisk eggs, half and half, mustard, thyme, salt, and pepper, and mix until combined. Pour the custard mixture on top of the entire strata. Cover the breakfast casserole with aluminum wrap and allow it to soak for at least 1 hr, overnight is best. When ready to bake, preheat the oven to 325 F. Bake the uncovered sourdough strata for 70-80 min until the center is cooked through and golden brown on top. 


Notes: I used a 9x13", reduce heat to 300F and cook for 50-55min. I added cooked mushrooms to the spinach layer. recipe has limitless combinations, from adding spring onion, tender bell peppers, crispy bacon, aldante asparagus, or whatever.
