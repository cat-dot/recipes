Espinacas con Garbanzos (Andalusian Spinach and Chickpeas)
  --America's Test Kitchen

1 slice (1 1/2 oz) crusty bread, torn into 1" pieces
2x15 oz cans chickpeas (1 can drained, 1 can undrained)
1 1/2 c chicken broth
6 tbsp evoo, divided
6 garlic cloves, minced
1 tbsp smoked paprika
1 tsp ground cumin
1/4 tsp table salt
1/8 tsp cinnamon
1/8 tsp cayenne pepper
1 small pinch saffron
2 small plum tomatoes, halved lengthwise, flesh shredded on large holes of box grater and skins discarded
4 tsp sherry vinegar + extra for seasoning
10 oz frozen chopped spinach, thawed and squeezed dry

Process bread in food processor until finely ground (you should have 3/4 c crumbs). Combine chickpeas and broth in large saucepan and bring to boil over high heat. Adjust heat to maintain simmer and cook until level of liquid is just below top layer of chickpeas, ~10 min. While chickpeas cook, heat 1/4 c oil in 10" nonstick or carbon-steel skillet over medium heat until just shimmering. Add bread crumbs and cook, stirring frequently, until deep golden brown, 3-4 min. Add garlic, paprika, cumin, salt, cinnamon, cayenne, and saffron and cook until fragrant, 30 s. Stir in tomatoes and vinegar; remove from heat. Stir bread mixture and spinach into chickpeas. Continue to simmer, stirring occasionally, until mixture is thick and stew-like, 5-10 min longer. Off heat, stir in remaining 2 tbsp oil. Cover and let stand for 5 min. Season with salt and extra vinegar to taste. Transfer to serving bowl and serve with remaining bread.



Notes: for vegan version: substitute vegetable broth or water for the chicken broth
