While oil heats, combine cornstarch, cornmeal, 1/2 tsp salt, and 1/4 tsp pepper in small bowl. Whisk coconut milk and hot sauce in large bowl. Add cauliflower, toss to coat. Sprinkle cornstarch mixture over cauliflower; fold with rubber spatula until thoroughly coated. Fry half cauliflower, adding 1 or 2 pieces to oil at a time, until golden and crispy, gently stirring as needed to prevent pieces from sticking together, ~3 min.
