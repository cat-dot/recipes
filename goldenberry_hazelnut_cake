Goldenberry Hazelnut Cake
   --Julie Morris

2 c hazelnuts
1 1/2 c spelt or gf flour
1/4 c chia powder
2 tsp baking powder
1/2 tsp baking soda
2/3 c unsweetened almond milk
3/4 c coconut palm sugar
3/4 c unsweetened applesauce
6 tbsp melted coconut oil
1 tsp vanilla
zest of 1 lemon + 1 tsp lemon juice
3 tbsp goldenberries, finely chopped

Preheat oven to 350F. Spray a 9x5" loaf pan with cooking spray and line with parchment to create a sling. Spread the hazelnuts out on a baking sheet. Roast for 8-12 min or until lightly browned and fragrant. Let cool, then rub off the skins from the nuts. Place the hazelnuts in a food processor and grind into a flour. Transfer to a medium bowl; add flour, chia powder, baking powder, and baking soda and mix well. In a large bowl, whisk together the milk and sugar. Add the applesauce, oil, vanilla, lemon zest and juice. Add the dry ingredients to the wet and stir until incorporated. Fold in the goldenberries. Transfer to the prepared loaf pan and smooth. Bake for 60-70 min or until a toothpick inserted comes out mostly clean and the top is golden brown. Let cake sit for 5 min in the pan before using the parchment sling to transfer to a rack to cool. Keeps for up to 3 days at room temp in airtight container.

Glaze (optional)
3/4 c cashews
1/4 c maple syrup
zest + juice of 1 lemon
1/2 c water
1/4 c arrowroot powder

Combine all ingredients in a blender and puree until completely smooth.

Notes: Can probably sub hazelnut flour/meal for the diy hazelnut flour. Goldenberries = gooseberries and is probably looking for dried variety in this recipe
