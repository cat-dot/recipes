Ginger Persimmon Bread
  --Valentina K. Wein

1 1/2 c grated Fuyu persimmons (about 1 pound persimmons)
1 1/2 tsp baking soda
1 1/2 c brown sugar
3/4 c olive oil
2 large eggs
1 large egg yolk
1 1/2 tbsp fresh ginger pulp
1 tbsp pure vanilla extract
1 1/4 tsp ground cinnamon
3/4 tsp ground cloves
3/4 tsp ground ginger
1/4 tsp salt
2 c ap flour
1/2 c crystallized ginger, finely chopped

Place a rack in the center of the oven and preheat to 350F. Grease a ~12" loaf pan with a light coating of olive oil. (It's easiest to do this with a spray, pastry brush or dab the oil on a paper towel to spread it around.) Set aside. Slice the stem ends off of the persimmons (just a 1/2" or so), then use a vegetable peeler or paring knife to peel them. Use either a hand held grater or a food processor with the grater attachment, to grate them. (You will need 1 1/2 c.) Now add the grated persimmon to a bowl and add the baking soda. Mix to blend and set aside. (The baking soda will help thicken the liquid derived from grating the fruit.) In a large mixing bowl, combine the brown sugar with the olive oil and mix to blend. Then add the eggs and egg yolk and mix again. Once it's smooth, stir in the fresh ginger, vanilla, cinnamon, cloves, ground ginger, and salt. Fold in the flour and mix just until it's fully incorporated. Then fold in the grated persimmon and crystallized ginger. Pour the batter into the prepared loaf pan and bake until it's golden brown, set, and beginning to crack on top, ~50 min. Let it cool in the pan for at least 30 min before serving.
