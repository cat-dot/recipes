2 c (10 oz) ap flour
1 1/2 c (8 1/4 oz) whole-wheat flour
1/2 c toasted wheat germ
3 tbsp sugar
1 1/2 tsp salt
1 tsp baking powder
1 tsp baking soda
1 3/4 c buttermilk
3 tbsp unsalted butter, melted and divided

Adjust oven rack to lower-middle position and heat oven to 400F. Line rimmed baking sheet with parchment paper. Whisk ap flour, whole-wheat flour, wheat germ, sugar, salt, baking powder, and baking soda together in large bowl. Combine buttermilk and 2 tbsp melted butter in 2 c liquid measuring cup. Add wet ingredients to dry ingredients and stir with rubber spatula until dough just comes together. Turn out dough onto lightly floured counter and knead until cohesive mass forms, ~8 turns. Pat dough into 7" round and transfer to prepared sheet. Using sharp serrated knife, make 1/4" deep cross ~5" long on top of loaf. Bake until skewer inserted in center comes out clean and loaf registers 195F, 45-50 min, rotating sheet halfway through baking. Remove bread from oven. Brush with remaining 1 tbsp melted butter. Transfer loaf to wire rack and let cool for at least 1 hr. Serve.
