Soda Bread
  --Sally's baking addiction

1 3/4 c (420ml) cold buttermilk
1 large egg (optional, see note)
4 1/4 c (515g) sp flour (spoon & leveled), + more for your hands and counter
3 tbsp (38g) granulated sugar
1 teaspoon baking soda
1 teaspoon salt
5 tbsp (70g) unsalted butter, cold and cubed*
optional: 1 cup (150g) raisins

Preheat oven to 400F (204C). There are options for the baking pan. Line a baking sheet with parchment paper or a silicone baking mat, use a seasoned 10-12" cast iron skillet, or grease a 9-10" cake pan or pie dish. Set aside. Whisk the buttermilk and egg together. Set aside. Whisk the flour, granulated sugar, baking soda, and salt together in a large bowl. Cut in the butter using a pastry cutter, a fork, or your fingers. Work the dough until into coarse crumbs, then stir in the raisins. Pour in the buttermilk/egg mixture. Gently fold the dough together until dough it is too stiff to stir. Pour crumbly dough onto a lightly floured work surface. With floured hands, work the dough into a ball as best you can, then knead for ~30 s or until all the flour is moistened. If the dough is too sticky, add a little more flour. Transfer the dough to the prepared skillet/pan. Using a very sharp knife, score an X into the top. Bake until the bread is golden brown and center appears cooked through, ~45 min. Loosely cover the bread with aluminum foil if you notice heavy browning on top. I usually place foil on top halfway through bake time. Remove from the oven and allow bread to cool for 10 min, then transfer to a wire rack. Serve warm, at room temperature, or toasted with desired toppings/spreads. Cover and store leftover bread at room temperature for up to 2 days or in the refrigerator for up to 1 week.
