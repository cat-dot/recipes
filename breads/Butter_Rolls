2 c ap flour (250 g)
1 tbsp baking powder
1/2 tsp salt
3/4 cup milk (180 ml)
1/4 cup melted butter (57 g)

Preheat oven to 350F / 175C. Grease 9x13" baking dish. Whisk dry ingredients. Add milk and butter. Stir into soft dough. Knead lightly 30 s. Roll into 1/4" thick rectangle (~12×16"). 

Filling:
1/2 c softened butter (113 g)
3/4 c sugar (150 g)
1 tsp cinnamon (optional)

Spread butter over dough. Sprinkle sugar (and cinnamon if using). Roll tightly into log. Slice 1 1/2–2" thick. Place in baking dish with small gaps.

Syrup:
2 cups whole milk OR water (480 ml)
1 1/2 c sugar (300 g)
4 tbsp butter (56 g)
1 tsp vanilla
pinch salt
Optional: 2 tbsp molasses or brown sugar

Heat ingredients until butter melts and sugar dissolves. Pour hot syrup around and between rolls until halfway up sides. Bake 45–55 min until golden, bubbling, and syrup thickened. Let stand 10–15 min before serving. Serve warm and scoop generously.


Notes: Milk = richer, custard-like syrup. Water = lighter traditional variation.
