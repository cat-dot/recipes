Lembas Bread
  --Cobi, jetsetfork

2 c gf ap flour (or ap flour)
1 ripe banana, mashed
1/4 c organic coconut oil
1/2 c maple syrup
2 tbsp white chia seeds + 6 tbsp water
pinch of sea salt

Optional
non-poisonous leaves (ex Hawaiian Ti leaves, but you could also use collard greens or banana leaves)
hemp twine

Mix chia and water,set aside for 5 min until it forms a gel. Add banana, coconut oil, maple syrup, the chia gel and a pinch of salt to a large mixing bowl. Gently mix in flour. Do not over mix or your Lembas will be tough. Form the dough into a ball and refrigerate for 1 hr before rolling out. Flour your rolling pin and work surface. Roll dough 1/4" thick and cut into squares with a cookie cutter. Use the blunt edge of a knife or spatula to mark an “X” on the top of each square. Do not cut all the way through. This “X’ will prevent the dough from rising and becoming misshapen. Bake at 350F for 25 min.
Optional: Wrap in leaves and secure with twine.
Store in air-tight container in refrigerator for up to 3 days.
