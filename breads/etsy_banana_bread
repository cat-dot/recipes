Banana Bread
  --Aravis Moore

1/2 c vegetable oil
1 c sugar
2 eggs
3-4 medium, ripe bananas (optional: reserve one banana for topping)
1/4 c milk
1 tsp vanilla
2 c ap flour
1 tsp baking soda
1/2 tsp kosher salt
1/2 c walnut halves (optional)
4 fresh figs (optional)

Preheat oven to 350F; grease 8 1/2"x4 1/2" loaf pan. Peel 3-4 medium-sized, ripe bananas. Mash with a fork if you prefer bigger bites of fruit, or puree for a more uniform texture. Set aside. In a medium bowl, combine the flour, baking soda, and salt. Set aside. In another medium bowl, whisk the oil and sugar together until combined. Add the eggs and mix to blend. Add the milk and vanilla, and whisk until incorporated. Stir in the mashed bananas. Add the dry ingredients to the wet, stirring just until combined. Pour the batter into the prepared pan and smooth the top with a spoon. Arrange your pre-selected toppings (figs, walnuts, etc) in a pretty pattern on top of the batter, pressing them down lightly. Sprinkle with a tablespoon of sugar. Bake for 55 minutes, or until a toothpick inserted in the center of the loaf comes out clean. Let the banana bread cool in the pan at least 10 min before turning out. Slice and server.


Notes: One topping could be ripe banana sliced lengthwise and laid across top. Other toppings include chocolate chips, streusel, etc.
