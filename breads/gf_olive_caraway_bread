Gluten-free Black Olive, Caraway, and Honey Bread
  --Aran Goyoaga

1 tsp evoo, for greasing
3/4 c (105 g) superfine brown rice flour, plus more for dusting
1 tbsp (25 g) honey
2 tsp (8 g) active dry yeast
1 2/3 c (400 g) filtered water, heated to 110F
4 tsp (15 g) psyllium husk powder
3/4 c (105 g) sorghum flour
3/4 c (90 g) tapioca starch
1 tbsp caraway seeds
1 1/2 tsp kosher salt
3/4 c (90 g) pitted black olives, roughly chopped
1 tbsp apple cider vinegar

Brush the bottom and sides of a 9x4" loaf pan with the evoo. Dust the inside with brown rice flour. In a medium bowl, whisk together the honey, yeast, and water. Set aside to proof for 10 min. Whisk in the psyllium powder, and let it gel for 5 to 10 min. In the bowl of a stand mixer, whisk together the brown rice flour, sorghum flour, tapioca starch, caraway seeds, and salt. Add the black olives, apple cider vinegar, and yeast mixture to the bowl. Mix with the dough hook on medium speed until it comes together into a moist and loose dough, ~2 min. Dust a work surface with brown rice flour, and turn the dough out onto it. Knead the dough a couple of times, shaping it into a loose log ~9" long. Gently transfer the dough to the loaf pan. Cover with a clean linen towel or plastic wrap and set aside to proof at room temperature for 1 hr, or until doubled. Preheat the oven to 425F. Dust the top of the dough with brown rice flour. Bake the bread for 1 hr. Carefully turn the bread out of the pan, and place it directly on the oven rack. Bake for an additional 45 min. Transfer the bread to a cooling rack and cool completely before cutting. The bread needs to set in the center as the steam evaporates otherwise it will have a gummy crumb. This bread keeps best wrapped in a clean kitchen towel or parchment paper for up to 3 days.


Notes: can change up mixins, add seeds and/or nuts instead of olives, etc. might be 325 not 425 for baking temp
