3/4 c (175g / 6.2 oz / 1 1/2 sticks) unsalted butter
1 c (135g) chopped pecans
2 c (330g) gluten-free flour (I like Bobâ€™s Red Mill 1:1)
1 c (120g) almond flour
1 tbsp (14g) baking soda
1 pinch fine sea salt
8 overripe bananas
1 1/2 c (266g) brown sugar
1 c (186g) date sugar
2 large eggs
1 tbsp finely grated lemon zest (~1 lemon)
1 tbsp (14g) pure vanilla extract
3/4 c frozen blueberries, for topping

Preheat oven to 400F. In a medium pot over medium head pot melt butter together with the pecans. Cook the butter with the pecans so that the nuts start to fry in the melted butter. Cook until the butter is very fragrant and right before it turns brown; remove from the heat and pour into a clean bowl to reserve. In a mixing bowl, whisk the gluten free flour, sea salt, baking soda, and almond flour together. In a separate mixing bowl, whisk the bananas, brown sugar, and date sugar together, then whisk in the eggs until smooth. Now add the lemon zest and vanilla extract to the warm melted butter pecan mixture to release the lemon oils into the mix. Now pour into the banana mixture and whisk till smooth to finish the cake. Pour the batter onto a half-sheet pan lined with a nonstick baking mat. Spread the batter evenly on to the sheet pan, then decorate the top with the frozen blueberries. Bake the bread in the oven for ~20-25 min, or until a cake tester comes out clean. Remove the bread cake from the oven and allow to chill before inverting and slicing.
