Spiced Sweet Potato Bread

1½ c ap flour
½ c wh0ole wheat flour
1 tsp baking soda
½ tsp baking powder
½ tsp salt
1½ tsp cinnamon
1 tsp cardamom
½ tsp nutmeg
⅛ tsp cloves
2 eggs, lightly beaten
½ c granulated sugar
½ c light brown sugar
½ c oil
1 tsp vanilla
⅓ c applesauce
¼ c water
2 tbsp molasses
1½ c peeled, grated sweet potato, tightly packed (~2 medium sweet potatoes)
½ c chopped dried fruit or nuts (optional)
¼ c turbinado sugar

Preheat the oven to 350°. Grease an 8½x4½" loaf pan and set aside. In a large bowl, combine the flours, baking soda, baking powder, salt, cinnamon, cardamom, nutmeg and cloves. In a separate bowl, whisk together the eggs, granulated and light brown sugars, oil, vanilla, applesauce, water and molasses. Add the sweet potato to the wet ingredients and stir with a spatula until fully incorporated. Pour the wet ingredients into the dry ingredients and mix together until just combined. If adding dried fruit, stir it into the batter with as few strokes as possible. Pour the batter into the prepared pan and sprinkle the turbinado sugar on top in an even layer. Bake the bread until the edges are golden brown and a cake tester comes out clean, ~1 hr. Cool in the pan for 10 min, then allow to cool on a wire rack for at least 30 min before serving.


Notes: probably can cut the amount of sugar
