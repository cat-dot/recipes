Cheddar and Scallion Soda Bread
  --The Field Company

4 c ap flour
1 1/2 tsp kosher salt
1 tsp baking soda
2 tbsp sugar
4 tbsp (1/2 stick) cold unsalted butter, cut into 1/2" pieces
1 c grated cheddar cheese
1 c sliced scallions
1 3/4 c buttermilk
1 large egg

Preheat the oven to 375F. In a mixing bowl, whisk together the flour, salt, baking soda, and sugar Stir to evenly mix dry ingredients. Add the butter and use a pastry cutter or your hands to rub the butter into the flour. You’re looking to separate the butter into smaller and smaller pieces, until the mixture resembles a coarse meal. Stir in the scallions and cheddar cheese until evenly mixed. In a small bowl, whisk the egg into the buttermilk. Add the wet ingredients to the dry, and stir until combined. Using your hands, knead the dough until all of the buttermilk has been incorporated, and there are no pockets of dry flour. (This won’t take long, only ~30 s. Be careful not to overwork your dough.) Transfer the dough to a flat, lightly floured work surface, and shape it into round loaf. (Your dough will be shaggy, similar to a biscuit dough, but that’s okay! No need to make it perfectly smooth.) Transfer the dough to a lightly greased No.8 Dutch oven. Using the tip of a knife, score an X on top of the loaf. Bake the bread, uncovered, for 50-55 min, or until golden brown and cooked through. (The top, center of the bread can often take the longest to cook. If your loaf begins browning too much before it cooks through, cover the Dutch oven.) Remove the Dutch oven and let cool for 15 min. Transfer the bread to a wire rack, then slice and serve warm or at room temperature.
