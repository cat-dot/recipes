Miso Banana Bread
  --Yi Jun Loh

3-4	(240g) overripe bananas + one more for garnish
1/2	c unsalted butter, softened at room temperature
3	tbsp shiro (sweet/white) miso
1/2	c caster sugar
1/2	c brown sugar
2	whole eggs
1	tsp vanilla 
1 3/4	c ap flour
1	tbsp baking powder
1/2	tsp cinnamon

Peel all the bananas, and mash up all but one with a fork. (That last one we’ll use as a garnish.) Heat your oven to 350F (175C) and ready a lined loaf tin for your banana bread batter. In a mixer with the paddle attachment, mix the butter, sweet miso, caster sugar, and brown sugar on medium speed until it turns light and fluffy. This should take 2-3 min. Then, add in the mashed bananas, eggs, and vanilla extract and mix for 30 s. The batter might start to look a little chunky and split at this point; don’t fret, this is perfectly normal. Finally, add in the dry ingredients (flour, baking powder and cinnamon) and mix for another 20-30 s, until a smooth batter forms. Pour the banana bread batter into the lined loaf tin. Then, take that extra banana you saved in step one, and slice it in half lengthwise. Place them on top of the batter, cut side up. Bake the banana bread in the oven for 60-75 min, rotating once 45 min into the baking process. To check for doneness, prick it in the middle with a skewer or cake tester; the cake is done when the skewer comes out clean. When done, let it cool in the tin for 30 min before digging in.
