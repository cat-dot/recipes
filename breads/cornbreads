Nothern Style Cornbread
  --The Field Company

5 tbsp unsalted butter
1 c yellow cornmeal
1 c ap flour
1/4 c sugar
2 tsp baking powder
1/2 tsp baking soda
1 tsp salt
1 c buttermilk
1 tbsp honey
1 large egg
1 ear of corn, kernels removed (~3/4 c kernels)

Arrange a rack in the center of the oven and place a 10 1/4" cast iron skillet on the rack. Preheat the oven to 425F. In a small saucepan, melt 4 tbsp of the butter over low heat and set aside to cool. In a large bowl, whisk together the cornmeal, flour, sugar, baking powder, baking soda, and salt. In a separate small bowl, whisk the buttermilk, egg, honey, and the cooled melted butter until well combined. Add the wet ingredient mixture to the dry ingredients and whisk gently until combined, being careful not to over mix. Gently fold the corn kernels into the batter with a rubber spatula. Carefully remove the hot skillet from the oven. Add the remaining 1 tbsp of butter to the skillet and swirl to evenly coat the bottom and all sides. Pour the batter into the hot, buttered skillet and use a rubber spatula to smooth the top. Return the skillet to the oven and bake until the top of the bread is lightly golden and a toothpick comes out clean when inserted into the center, ~20 min. Allow the cornbread to cool in the pan for 5 min before slicing and serving.
