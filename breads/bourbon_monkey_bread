1 stick unsalted butter
1 c dark brown sugar
1/2 c heavy cream
1/4 c maple syrup
1 tsp kosher salt
2 tbsp bourbon

In a small saucepan, combine the butter and brown sugar over medium high heat. Bring to a simmer and cook until the sugar dissolves, 1-2 min. Add the cream, maple syrup, and salt, then cook until bubbling vigorously, 1-2 min more. Remove from the heat and stir in the bourbon, then let cool completely.

Dough:
1/4 oz (2 1/4 tsp) active dry yeast
1 1/4 c whole milk, heated to 115F
1 tbsp maple syrup
1 tsp kosher salt
2 eggs, lightly beaten
1 stick unsalted butter, melted + more for greasing
4 1/2 c ap flour

In the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with the paddle attachment, stir together the yeast with the milk and maple syrup. Let sit until foamy, 10 min. Stir in the salt, eggs, and butter until incorporated. Add the flour, then mix until a smooth dough forms. Cover with plastic wrap and let sit in a warm place until doubled in size, 1 hr. Preheat the oven to 350F.

Assembly:
1 1/4 c granulated sugar
1 tbsp cinnamon
1 stick unsalted butter, melted

In a small bowl, stir together the sugar and cinnamon to incorporate. Rip off 1 tbsp size piece of dough at a time and roll into a ball. Dip each ball of dough into the melted butter followed by the cinnamon sugar. Layery the coated balls of dough in a greased bundt pan. As soon as you have covered the bottom of the bundt pan, drizzle 1/2 c of the caramel over the dough. Repeat this process 2 more times, making sure you have used up all of the balls of dough and have 1/4 c of the caramel left. Bake until the monkey bread has risen and the top is golden brown, 30-35 min. Remove from the oven and let cool for 10 min.

2 tbsp bourbon

In a medium bowl, whisk all of the glaze ingredients until smooth. Invert the monkey bread onto a plate. Drizzle with the remaining caramel and the bourbon glaze, then serve.
