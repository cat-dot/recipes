Roasted Squash + Herb Pesto Bread
Forneau

Herb Pesto:
Take a small handfull of sage and oregano or other savory herbs and finely chop. In a small bowl, drizzle the herbs with oil just to moisten them into a paste. Do not too much oil to the mix. Sprinkle in a few pinches of coarse salt. You will not need this until the next day so if you prepare in advance, be sure to refrigerate.

Bread:
2.5 c (400g) unbleached white bread flour
.5 c (100g) freshly ground oat flour (grind 100g rolled outs in blender)
1.75 c (375g) water
.5 c (150g) cubed roasted butternut squash (or similar variety)
.25 c (75g) herb pesto
1 tsp (10g) sea salt
.5 tsp (2g) yeast

Mix all dry ingredients together thoroughly. Add water to dry mixture and mix until all of the flour is saturated. Cover the bowl toghtly with plastic wrap. Allow dough to rise for 12-18 hrs, depending on weather and temp. Turn dough out onto floured work surface. Divide dough into 2 portions. Shape dough portions carefully, and then doth the surface with squash. Create the first envelope fold, and then add more squash. Complete the envelope fold and then roll fold and seal seam. Allow to rest for ~45 min. Turn loaves over so seam side is up, and slightly flatten them. Add a line of the herb pesto down the center, and then create the first envelope fold. Add another line of pesto down the center after the first folding, then complete the envelope fold. Roll fold and seal the seam. Allow to rise covered for 45 min - 1 hr. Preheat oven to 485F while bread is resting. When ready to bake, roll or life the formed loaf onto the peel dusted with bran or cornmeal. Score the loaf with a single long slash. Slide loaf off peel into the forneau and close hatch. Cook with hatch closed for 15-20 min. Remove hatch and cook with hatch off for an additional 5 min. Remove from oven and allow to cool completely.
