Pumpkin Corn Bread
  --Hayden Flour Mills
  
Corn Bread:
1 1/4 c water
1/2 c neutral oil
15 oz can pumpkin puree
1 tsp pumpkin pie spice
1/4 c brown sugar
1 box Yellow Cornbread Mix
1 tbsp butter (for skillet)

Place cast iron skillet in oven on middle rack and preheat to 450F. In a medium bowl, whisk together water, oil, pumpkin puree, spice, and sugar until a homogeneous mixture forms. Add Yellow Cornbread Mix and stir just until the mixture comes together. Be careful not to over mix. Remove the skillet from the oven, and reduce oven temperature to 400 F. To the hot skillet, add 1 tbsp of butter, allowing it to sizzle until melted, then swirl to coat the botton of your skillet. Pour the batter into the skillet and bake for 35-40 min until the top is a deep golden brown and a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean. 

Maple Glaze:
1/4 c butter
1 tbsp maple syrup
1 1/2 tsp powdered sugar

Whisk together all ingrdients and set aside. When cornbread is done baking, remove the skillet from the oven and set on a cooling rack or hot pad. Brush glaze on top and serve immediately.


Notes:  promptly remove the cornbread once it has cooled sufficiently to prevent rust.
