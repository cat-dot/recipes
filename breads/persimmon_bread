  --Candice Walker

1 1/4 c ap flour
1/2 tsp kosher salt
1 1/2 tsp baking soda
1 tsp cinnamon
1/4 tsp ground nutmeg
1/4 tsp ground cloves
2 eggs room temperature
1/2 tsp vanilla
1/2 c unsalted butter room temperature + more for greasing your loaf pan
1/4 c sugar
1 c persimmon puree

Preheat to 350F. Lightly grease 9x5x3" loaf pan. In a medium bowl sift the dry ingredients. Flour, salt, baking soda, cinnamon, nutmeg, and cloves. In a large bowl, cream the butter and sugar. In a small bowl, beat the eggs with the vanilla. With a hand mixer or standing mixer slowly pour the egg mixture into the creamed butter and sugar. Mix well. Add the persimmon. Remove from mixer. With a spoon or rubber spatula, add the flour mixture to the wet ingredients 1/3 at a time. Mix with a rubber spatula until just incorporated. Pour into loaf pan. Optional to top with thinly sliced persimmons. Cook 48-55 min until a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean. Cool completely. 


Notes: Usually when baking in a glass pan, the temperature should be 25 degrees lower, and will take up to 10 min longer. the over-ripe hachiya works best in the batter of this recipe.
