Green Chile and Tomatillo Corn Bread

2 pobalno peppers, one whole and one halved, stemmed and seeded
2 jalapeno peppers, one whole and one halved, stemmed and seeded
1/2 medium white onion, peeled
1 c yellow cornmeal
1 c flour
1 tbsp sugar
2 tsp kosher salt
2 tsp baking powder
1 tsp baking soda
1/2 tsp ground cumin
1/2 c buttermilk
1/2 c cilantro leaves, loosely packed
5 tbsp unsalted butter, melted and cooled + more for greasing
4 small (8oz) tomatillos, husked and sliced in half
1 egg lightly beaten
1 c (4 oz) grated moneterey jack cheese

Set the oven to broil, with the rack about 6" away from the heat source. Line a baking sheet with foil. Roast the whole poblano pepper, the whole jalapeno pepper, and the onion, turning occasionally, until evenly blistered and blackened in some spots, 10-12 min. Remove from the oven and carefully gather the edges of the foil to enclose the roasted peppers and onion. Allow to cool completely, then stem, peel, seed, and roughly chop the peppers and onion. Set aside. Lower the oven to 350F and grease an 8" square baking dish. In a medium bowl, whisk together the cornmeal, flour, sugar, salt, baking powder, baking soda, and cumin. In a blender, puree the remaining halved poblano, halved jalapeno, buttermilk, cilantro, melted butter, tomatillos, and egg until smooth. Transfer the mixture to a large bowl and slowly fold in the dry ingredients until just incorporated. Stir in the chopped, roasted peppers and onion along with the cheese. Pour the batter into the prepared pan and smooth the top with a rubber spatula. Bake until golden brown and a toothpick comes out clean when inserted into the center, ~30min. Let cool completely before cutting into squares.
