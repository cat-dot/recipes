Strawberry Banana Bread
  --Food Network Kitchen

1/2 c vegetable oil + more for greasing pan
1/2 c + 2 tbsp walnuts
1 1/2 c ap flour
3/4 c sugar
1 tsp baking powder
1/2 tsp cinnamon
1/2 tsp freshly grated nutmeg
1/2 tsp fine sea salt
2 large eggs
1 tsp vanilla
1/2 tsp lemon zest
2 very ripe bananas, mashed
8 oz strawberries, hulled and cut into 1/4 - 1/2" pieces

Preheat oven to 350F. Greas a 9x5" loaf pan. Roughly chop 1/2 c walnuts and finely chop the remaining 2 tbsp, keeping them separate. Whisk together the flour, sugar, roughly chopped nuts, baking powder, cinnamon, nutmeg, and salt in a medium bowl. Whisk together the oil, eggs, vanilla, and zest in a separate bowl. Fold in the bananas and strawberries. Fold the oil mixture into the flour mixture until just combined (it's ok if there are lumps). Transfer the batter to the prepared pan, and sprinkle the top with the remaining nuts. Bake until the bread is golden brown and a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean, 60-70 min. Run a knife around the edges, and let cool completely in the pan on a rack. The bread can be stored at room temp in an airtight container for up to 3 days.
