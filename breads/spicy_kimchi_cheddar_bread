Spicy Kimchi Cheddar Bread
 --Sarah Jampel

4 tbsp (36g) sesame seeds, divided
2 1/2 c (300g) ap flour
2 tsp baking powder
1 tsp baking soda
3/4 tsp table salt
1/2 tsp freshly ground black pepper
8 oz (227g) sharp cheddar cheese
4 tbsp (57g) unsalted butter, cold
3 medium (45g-55g) scallions, finely chopped
1 c (136g) kimchi, drained, finely chopped*
1/4 c (48g) kimchi liquid, from draining and pressing the kimchi solids
1 c (227g) buttermilk
1 large egg

Preheat the oven to 375F with a rack in the center. Grease an 8" square pan. Sprinkle ~2 tbsp (18g) of the sesame seeds in an even layer across the bottom of the pan. In a large bowl, whisk together the flour, baking powder, baking soda, salt, and black pepper. Grate the cheese and the butter on the large holes of a box grater. Add the cheese, butter, and scallions to the dry ingredients, toss to coat, and place the bowl in the refrigerator while you prepare the rest of the ingredients. In a liquid measuring cup, whisk together the kimchi liquid, buttermilk, and egg until well combined. (If you are not able to get 1/4 c kimchi liquid from straining and pressing the solids, add enough buttermilk to reach 1 1/4 c or 283g total liquid.) Set aside. Add the chopped kimchi to the dry ingredients, tossing to combine. Pour the buttermilk mixture into the dry ingredients and stir with a fork or flexible spatula just until everything is evenly moistened. Transfer the batter to the prepared pan and smooth out the top. Sprinkle evenly with the remaining 2 tbsp (18g) sesame seeds. Bake the kimchi cheddar bread for 38-45 minu, until a toothpick or paring knife comes out clean and the temperature in the center of the bread registers at least 200F. Let the kimchi cheddar bread cool in the pan for 10 min before transferring to a wire rack. Let it cool for another 10 min before slicing. 


Notes: taste the kimchi before using - adjust salt to preference
