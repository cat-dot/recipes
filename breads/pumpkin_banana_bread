Pumpkin Banana Bread
  --Amanda Neal
  
nonstick cooking spray
4 c ap flour 
2 tsp baking soda 
2 tsp pumpkin pie spice 
1 tsp baking powder 
1 tsp kosher salt 
4 very ripe bananas 
4 large eggs 
2 c sugar 
15 oz can pure pumpkin puree (~1 1/2 c) 
1 c vegetable oil 
1/2 c sour cream 
2 tsp vanilla  
6 tbsp raw pepitas 

Preheat an oven to 350 F. Line two 9x5" loaf pans with parchment paper, leaving a 2" overhang on the longer sides, then spray with nonstick cooking spray. Whisk together the flour, baking soda, pumpkin pie spice, baking powder and salt in a medium bowl until combined. Mash the bananas in a large bowl with a potato masher or fork until smooth, then whisk in the eggs, sugar, pumpkin puree, oil, sour cream and vanilla until smooth and combined. Add the flour mixture to the banana mixture, then stir the batter together with a rubber spatula until just combined (itâ€™s ok if there are a couple small lumps).  Divide the batter evenly between the 2 prepared loaf pans, smoothing out the top with a spatula. Top each loaf with 3 tbsp of pepitas. Bake in the center of the oven until a toothpick inserted in the center of each loaf comes out clean and each loaf reaches an internal temperature of 200-205 F, 60-75 min. Let cool in the pans for 15 min, then use the parchment paper overhang to remove each loaf from the pan. Let cool completely on a wire rack, ~1 1/2 hr.
