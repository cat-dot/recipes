Popover

3 tbsp melted butter, divided
1 1/2 c ap flour
1 tsp kosher salt
3 large eggs at room temp
1 1/2 c whole milk, warmed to ~100F

Put oven rack at lowest shelf and preheat to 450F. Grease a 6 cup nonstick metal popover pan with 1 tbsp of melted butter and set aside. In a small bowl, combine the flour and salt. In a separate large mixing bowl, vigorously whisk together the eggs and milk until thoroughly combined and some bubbles form on the surface, 1 min. Whisk in the flour mixture and, when almost combined, whisk in the remaining melted butter. Mix until just combined (a few small lumps are ok). Ladle the batter into the popover tins, filling each up 3/4 of the way. Bake for 15 min, then reduce heat to 350F and continue to bake until the popovers are puffed and golden brown, another 7-9 min. Remove the pan from the oven and let the popovers sit for 30s-1min. Turn them out and serve immediately.

Rose Cardamom: 

5 tbsp granulated sugar
1 1/2 tsp dried food grade rose petals, crushed
1 1/2 tsp ground cardamom
1/4 tsp rose water (optional)

In a small bowl mix all ingredients together. After removing the popovers from the oven, sprinkle with the mixture. Turn them out and sprinkle with the remaining sugar before serving.


Parmesan Lemon Thyme:

1/2 c finely grated parmesan cheese
3 tbsp chopped thyme
1/2 tsp freshly cracked black pepper
zest of 1 meyer lemon, finely grated

In a small bowl mix all ingredients together. After greasing the popover pan, divide half of the mixture among the bottoms of the tins. Fill each tin with the batter and evenly distribute the remaining mixture over the top of the batter. Bake as usual.
