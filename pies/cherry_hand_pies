Sweet Cherry Hand Pies
  --Sur La Table cooking class

1 lb pitted and halved sweet red cherries
3/4 c  sugar
2 tbsp almond meal
2 tbsp cornstarch
1/8 tsp almond extract
1/8 tsp kosher salt
1 recipe Vanilla Shortcrust Dough
1 large egg beaten for egg wash
Sanding sugar, for garnish

Preheat oven to 350°F and place rack in the center. In a medium bowl toss together cherries, sugar, almond meal, cornstarch, extract and salt to combine, set aside. Remove pie dough from the refrigerator ~15 min before rolling. Generously flour a work surface and place chilled dough disk on the flour. Dust the top of the dough with flour. Using a rolling pin, roll chilled dough into a circle, turning and flipping the dough as needed with a bench scraper to prevent sticking, until the circle measures 15" and 1/8" thick. Using 4 1/2" round cookie cutter, cut 8 circles of dough, rerolling once as needed. Place 1 tbsp of cherry filling in the center of each dough circle. Using a small brush, brush the dough edge halfway around with egg wash. Fold un-brushed dough edge over to create a half-circle shape and press to seal and remove any air bubbles. Press edge with fork tines to create a decorative edge and ensure sealing. Place assembled hand pies on a parchment paper-lined baking sheet. Continue with remaining dough circles and freeze assembled pies for 15 min before baking. Save remaining egg wash. Remove hand pies from freezer and cut a small “x” in the top of each with a sharp paring knife. Brush tops of pies with egg wash to coat; sprinkle each with sanding sugar and place baking sheet in preheated oven. Bake until hand pies are golden brown, ~12-15 min. Remove from oven and allow pies to cool for 5 min. Using a large spatula, transfer pies to a cooling rack. Hand pies can be served warm or room temperature.



Notes: can use frozen cherries if fresh not available
