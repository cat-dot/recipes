Key Lime Pie

Crust:
2 c graham cracker crumbs
6 tbsp unsalted butter, melted
1 tbsp sugar
1/2 tsp salt

Preheat oven to 350F. In a medium bowl, stir together all the ingredients until incorporated. Press the mixture evenly on the bottom and up the sides of a 9" pie plate. Bake until the crust is set, 10-15 min. Let cool.


Filling:
6 egg yolks
2x14oz cans sweetened condensed milk
1 c fresh key lime juice
1 tsp key lime zest + more for garnish
1/2 tsp salt

In a medium bowl, whisk together the yolks and milk until smooth. Add the remaining ingredients and whisk until smooth. Pour into the cooled pie shell, return to the oven and bake for 20 min. Remove from the oven and let cool completely, then chill overnight.


Topping:
2 egg whites
1/2 c sugar
1/4 c water

The next day make the topping. In a medium bowl, using an electric hand mixer, beat the egg whites until soft peaks form. In a small saucepan, combine the sugar and water over medium high heat. Bring to a boil and cook until the syrup has reached 240F. With the mixer's motor running, slowly pour the syrup into the egg whites and continue to beat until stiff peaks form and the meringue has cooled completely, 5 min. Spoon onto the center of the pie and torch until golden. Garnish with zest, then slice and serve.
