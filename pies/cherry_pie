Cherry Pie
  --Meghan Splawn

Filling:
3/4 c sugar
1/4 c cornstarch
1 1/2 lb (~4 1/2 c) fresh sweet cherries, stemmed and pitted
1 tbsp vanilla
1/4 tsp kosher salt

Whisk the sugar and cornstarch together in a large saucepan. Add the cherries, vanilla, and salt and toss to coat in the sugar-cornstarch mixture. Cook over medium-high heat until the cherries begin to break down and the mixture begins to simmer and thicken slightly, 8-10 min. Remove from the heat and let cool completely while you prepare the crust, or move to an airtight container for longer term storage in the refrigerator or freezer.

14-16 oz package prepared pie crusts, thawed if frozen (or 2 homemade pie crusts)
1 large egg
1 tsp water
1 tbsp coarse sugar, such as demerara

Arrange a rack in the middle of the oven, set a baking sheet on it, and heat the oven to 375F. Unroll one of the pie doughs and transfer it to a 9" standard pie pan. Press the dough into the bottom and along the sides of the pie plate, being careful not to puncture the dough. Whisk the egg and water together with a fork in a small bowl to make an egg wash. Brush the inside of the pie crust with a thin layer of the egg wash (save the remaining for brushing the top crust). Pour the cooled filling into the crust. Unroll the second pie dough and lightly flour the surface. Cut into 1" wide strips. Transfer every other strip to the top of the pie, spacing them evenly. Create a lattice pattern by alternating and folding in the remaining strips. Brush the lattice crust and edges of the pie dough with the egg wash, then sprinkle generously with the coarse sugar. Place the pie on the hot baking sheet and bake until the filling is bubbling, 40-45 min. If the edges of the pie crust are browning too quickly, cover the edges of the pie with aluminum foil during the last 10 min of baking. Transfer the pie to a wire cooling rack and cool completely before slicing, ~4 hr.


Notes: I addded lemon juice to the filling
