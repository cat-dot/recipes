Sour Orange Pie
  --America's Test Kitchen

Crust:
5 oz animal crackers
3 tbsp sugar
pinch salt
4 tbsp unsalted butter, melted

Adjust oven rack to middle position and heat oven to 325F. Process crackers, sugar, and salt in food processor until finely ground, ~30 s. Add melted butter and pulse until combined, ~8 pulses. Transfer to 9" pie tin. Using bottom of dry measuring cup, press crumbs firmly into bottom and up sides of tin. Bake crust until fragrant and beginning to brown, 12-14 min. Let cool completely, ~30 min.

Filling:
14 oz can sweetened condensed milk
6 tbsp frozen oj concentrate, thawed
4 large egg yolks
2 tsp grated lemon zest + 6 tbsp juice (2 lemons)
1 tsp grated orange zest
pinch salt

Whisk all ingredients in a bowl until fully combined. Pour filling into cooled crust. Bake pie until center jiggles slightly when shaken, 15-17 min. Let cool completely. Refrigerate until fully chilled, at least 3 hrs, or cover with greased plastic wrap and refrigerate for up to 24 hrs. 

Topping:
3/4 c heavy cream, chilled
2 tbsp sugar
1/2 tsp grated orange zest

Whisk all ingredients in medium bowl until stiff peaks form, 2-4 min. Serve with pie slices.


Note: if sour oranges are available, use 3/4 c strained sour oj in place of lemon juice and oj concentrate. Depending on the brand, 5 oz is between 80 and 90 animal crackers.
