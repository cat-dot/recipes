Basque Cheesecake
  --Sur la Table
  
Unsalted butter or cooking spray for greasing pan
3/4 c sugar
1/3 c cornstarch
1/2 tsp kosher salt
18 oz cream cheese, room temperature
3 large eggs
1 c heavy whipping cream
2 tsp vanilla extract

Preheat oven to 425F. Coat a loaf pan with butter or cooking spray, line with parchment paper, press into the corners then up the sides of the pan. Set the loaf pan on a rimmed baking sheet. To the bowl of a stand mixer fitter with a paddle attachment or a large bowl using a hand mixer add the sugar, cornstarch, and salt; whisk by hand to combine. Add the cream cheese and beat, starting on low speed, then working your way to high speed until the mixture is smooth. Stop to scrape the sides of the bowl with a silicone spatula and then repeat. Add the eggs one at a time, scraping the sides of the bowl in between each addition. Add the cream, and vanilla if using and beat on low until fully incorporated. Pour into the prepared loaf pan and transfer to preheated oven and bake until browned and almost burnt on top, rotating the pan halfway through the baking time, ~35-50 min. The cheesecake should be jiggly when shimmied. Transfer the baked cheesecake to a wire rack to cool to room temperature, then cover with plastic wrap and refrigerate for at least 1 hr before serving. We recommend waiting a full day before slicing, but understand patience is hard when waiting for cheesecake.
