2 large eggs
1/2 c half-and-half
1/2 tsp hot sauce
1/2 tsp pepper
35 Ritz crackers
1/2 c ap flour
1/2 tsp table salt, divided
8 tbsp unsalted butter, melted, divided

Adjust oven rack to middle position and heat oven to 425F. Whisk eggs, half-and-half, hot sauce, and pepper together in large bowl; set aside. Pulse crackers, flour, and 1/4 tsp salt in food processor until coarsely ground, 8-10 pulses. Add 6 tbsp melted butter and pulse until crumbs are evenly moistened, ~5 pulses.

Cover and cook over medium-high heat, stirring occasionally, until onions are softened, ~8 min. Stir onions into egg mixture. Stir in cheddar and chives. Transfer onion mixture to crust. Bake until set and center of pie registers 165F, 14-17 min. Let cool for 5 minutes. Serve.
