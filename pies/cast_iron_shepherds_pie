  --America's Test Kitchen

2 lb russet potatoes, peeled and cut into 1" pieces
salt and pepper
1/2 c milk
1 large egg
4 tbsp unsalted butter, melted, + 2 tbsp unsalted butter
2 carrots, peeled and chopped
1 onion, chopped fine
1 1/2 lb 93% lean ground beef
2 tbsp tomato paste
2 garlic cloves, minced
2 tsp minced fresh thyme or 1/2 tsp dried
2 tbsp ap flour
1 1/2 c chicken broth
2 tsp Worcestershire sauce

Cover potatoes with water in large saucepan. Add 1 tbsp salt, bring to simmer over medium-high heat, and cook until potatoes are tender, 8-10 min. Drain potatoes and return to now-empty saucepan. Using potato masher, mash potatoes until smooth. Whisk milk and egg together, then stir into potatoes along with 4 tbsp melted butter, 1 tsp salt, and 1/2 tsp pepper; cover and set aside. Heat 10" cast-iron skillet over medium heat for 3 min. Melt remaining 2 tbsp butter in skillet. Add carrots, onion, and 3/4 tsp salt and cook until softened, ~5 min. Add ground beef and cook, breaking up meat with wooden spoon, until no longer pink, 8-10 min. Stir in tomato paste, garlic, and thyme and cook until fragrant, ~1 min. Stir in flour and cook for 1 min. Slowly stir in broth and Worcestershire, scraping up any browned bits and smoothing out any lumps. Bring to simmer and cook, stirring occasionally, until mixture has thickened slightly, ~10 min. Off heat, stir in peas and season with salt and pepper to taste. Adjust oven rack 5" from broiler element and heat broiler. Transfer potato mixture to gallon zipper-lock bag and snip off 1 corner to create 1" opening. Pipe mixture in even layer over filling. Smooth mixture with back of spoon, then use tines of fork to make ridges on surface. Place skillet in rimmed baking sheet and broil until topping is golden brown and crusty, 5-10 minutes. Let casserole cool for 10 min before serving.



Note: To make slightly more traditional, use ground lamb and adjust cook time as needed.
