In the work bowl of a food processor, place flour, sugar, and salt; pulse until combined. Add cold butter, pulsing until mixture is crumbly. Add 1/3 c + 2 tsp (90 g) ice water and orange zest and juice, pulsing until dough just comes together. Divide dough in half and shape each half into a disk. Wrap tightly in plastic wrap and refrigerate for 30 min.  Preheat oven to 350F (180C). On a lightly floured surface, roll half of dough into a 12" circle. Transfer to a 9" pie plate, pressing into bottom and up sides. Trim excess dough to 1/2" beyond edge of plate. Fold edges under. Prick the bottom and sides of dough with a fork. Refrigerate for at least 30 min. Using a sharp knife, cut 1/2" wide strips. Using 3 strips at a time, braid the dough and pinch the ends to hold the braid together. On a lightly floured surface, roll remaining dough into a 10" circle. Using a sharp knife, cut 1/2" wide strips. Braid dough strips, pinching ends to seal. Brush water on rim of prepared dough in plate. Place braided dough along brushed rim. Overlap end pieces, and pinch together to seal. In a small bowl, whisk together egg and 1 tsp (5 g) water; lightly brush over dough. Top dough with a piece of parchment paper, letting ends extend over edges of plate. Add pie weights. Bake for 15 min. Carefully remove paper and weights. Bake until golden brown, ~15 min more. Let cool for 10 min. Arrange 1 c (200 g) pineapple in bottom of prepared crust. Top with Toasted Coconut Pastry Cream. Top with remaining 3 c (600 g) pineapple. Garnish with coconut, if desired.
