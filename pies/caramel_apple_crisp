Skillet Caramel Apple Crisp
  --Sur la Table

Caramel:
1/2 c heavy whipping cream
1/8 c water
1/2 c granulated sugar
1 tbsp unsalted butter, cut into 1/2-inch cubes
1/2 tsp sea salt + more to taste

In a small saucepan, heat the cream just until it begins to boil. Remove from the heat and set aside. Add sugar and water to a medium saucepan. Place pan over medium-low heat and stir with a wooden spoon or silicone spatula until the sugar is dissolved and the liquid is clear. Increase the heat to high and boil rapidly, swirling the pan occasionally (do not stir) so that the sugar cooks evenly. Cook until the caramel turns a deep golden brown. Test the color by dipping a clean spoon into the caramel and dripping a bit on a white plate. Immediately turn off the heat and add the warmed cream, butter, and salt. (Be careful hereâ€”the mixture will rise dramatically in the pan and sputter.) Stir with the wooden spoon or the spatula to blend. If any bits of caramel have solidified, set the pan back over very low heat and stir gently until they melt. Cool the caramel to room temperature. Add more salt, to taste.
  
Crisp:
1 c ap flour
3/4 c old-fashioned rolled oats
3/4 c firmly packed light brown sugar
1 tsp cinnamon
1/2 tsp salt
1 stick (1/2 c) unsalted butter, cut into bits and softened
3 lb McIntosh apples, peeled and sliced 1/3" thick (~8 c)
2 tbsp freshly squeezed lemon juice
1/2 c sugar
1 tbsp corn starch

In a bowl, stir together the flour, oats, brown sugar, cinnamon, and salt. Add the butter, blend the mixture until it resembles coarse meal. In a large bowl, toss the apples with the lemon juice, granulated sugar, cooled caramel and corn starch and transfer the mixture to 9" cast iron skillet. Crumble the topping evenly over the apple mixture and bake the crisp in the middle of preheated oven until the apples are cooked through and the top is golden, ~25-30 min. Let the crisp stand for 10 min and serve it warm with the cinnamon ice cream.
