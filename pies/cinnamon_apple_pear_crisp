Cinnamon Apple Pear Crisp
  --Sally McKenney

Filling:
4 medium/large ripe pears, peeled and sliced (4–5 c, or 500–625g, slices)*
3 medium/large apples, peeled and sliced (4–5 c, or 500–625g, slices)*
1/2 c (100g) packed light or dark brown sugar
1/4 c (31g) ap flour
1 tsp vanilla
1 tsp cinnamon
1/2 tsp nutmeg
1/4 tsp salt

Preheat oven to 350F (177C). Lightly grease a 9×13" baking pan. Mix all of the filling ingredients together in a large bowl, then spread into the baking pan. 

Topping:
3/4 c (94g) ap flour (spooned & leveled)
3/4 c (150g) packed light or dark brown sugar
1 tsp ground cinnamon
1/2 c (8 tbsp; 113g) unsalted butter, cold and cubed
1 c (85g) old-fashioned whole rolled oats
optional: 1 c (125g) chopped pecans

Whisk the flour, brown sugar, and cinnamon together in a medium bowl. Cut in the butter using a pastry cutter or fork until the mixture becomes super crumbly. Stir in the oats. Sprinkle over filling. Bake for 40-45 min or until the topping is golden brown and the fruit juices are bubbling around the edges. Remove from the oven, place on a wire rack, and allow to cool for at least 5 min before serving. Serve warm, room temperature, or cold.


Notes: I used walnuts; can be made with gf flour; would suggest upping cinnamon
