Butter Pie Crust
  --America's Test Kitchen

2 1/2 c unbleached ap flour (12 1/2 oz), + flour for work surface
1 tsp table salt
1 tbsp sugar
16 tbsp unsalted butter (2 sticks), cold, cut into 1/2" cubes and frozen for 10 min
3 tbsp sour cream
1/3 c ice water, or more if needed

Process flour, salt, and sugar together in food processor until combined, ~3 s. Add butter and pulse until butter is size of large peas, ~10 1-s pulses. Using fork, mix sour cream and 1/3 c ice water in small bowl until combined. Add half of sour cream mixture to flour mixture; pulse for 3 1-s pulses. Repeat with remaining sour cream mixture. Pinch dough with fingers; if dough is floury, dry, and does not hold together, add 1-2 tbsp ice water and process until dough forms large clumps and no dry flour remains, 3-5 1-s pulses. Turn dough out onto work surface. Divide dough into 2 balls and flatten each into 4" disk; wrap each disk in plastic and refrigerate until firm but not hard, 1-2 hr, before rolling. (Dough can be refrigerated for up to 24 hr. Let thoroughly chilled dough stand at room temperature for 15 min before rolling.) Remove 1 disk of dough from refrigerator and roll out between 2 large sheets of parchment paper or plastic wrap to 12" circle, ~1/8" thick. (If dough becomes soft and/or sticky, return to refrigerator until firm.) Remove parchment from one side of dough and flip onto 9" pie plate; peel off second layer of parchment. Working around circumference, ease dough into plate by gently lifting edge of dough with one hand while pressing into plate bottom with other hand. Leave dough that overhangs plate in place; refrigerate until dough is firm, ~30 min. Meanwhile, roll second disk of dough between 2 large sheets of parchment paper or plastic wrap to 12" circle, ~1/8" thick. Refrigerate, leaving dough between parchment sheets, until firm, ~30 min.
