Spelt Crust
  --Nea Arentzen

1 2/3 c (scant) (168 g) spelt flour
1 tbsp granulated white sugar
1/2 tsp Diamond Crystal kosher salt
1/2 c (113 g) cold unsalted butter, cut into 1/2" cubes
1/4 c (56 g) ice-cold water

In a large bowl, combine the spelt flour, sugar, and salt. Add the chilled butter cubes and use your hands or a pastry cutter to press the flour into the butter until the butter is the size of small peas and the dough resembles coarse sand. Slowly pour in half of the cold water and mix with a fork. Add the remaining water where the dry spots are. Shape the dough into a ball and flatten it out slightly. Wrap the dough in plastic wrap and refrigerate until firm, ~30-40 min. Unwrap the chilled pie dough and place it on a piece of parchment paper. Sprinkle flour on both sides, then use a rolling pin to roll the dough into a 12" wide circle. Prick holes all over with a fork. Place the crust back in the fridge and chill for another 10 min.
