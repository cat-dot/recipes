Potato Crust Quiche Lorraine
  --Sara Cagle

4 tbsp melted butter, divided by half
1 bag hash brown potatoes, thawed (1 lb 4 oz works perfectly.)
salt and pepper, to taste
1/2 tsp nutmeg
1 heaping tbsp Dijon mustard
1 tbsp olive oil
4 slices bacon, chopped into 1/4" pieces
1 large onion, diced
1 tbsp finely chopped fresh thyme
2 cloves garlic, minced
6 eggs
1/2 c half and half
1 1/2 c shredded Gruyere

Preheat oven to 400 F. Brush a cast-iron skillet or pie pan with 2 tbsp melted butter. In a large bowl, combine potatoes, salt, pepper, nutmeg, and mustard. Press the mixture into the skillet, making sure the bottom has no gaps and the height is level all the way around. Pour the remaining butter evenly over the top. Bake until golden, ~30 min. Let cool for at least 5 min. Meanwhile, heat olive oil in a skillet over medium-high heat, and cook bacon briefly, ~3 min. Add onion, thyme, garlic, salt, and pepper. Reduce heat to medium and cook until softened, stirring frequently, for ~13 min. In another large bowl, whisk eggs and half and half until smooth. Add the bacon mixture to a large bowl and stir quickly to combine. Pour the filling into the cooled crust. Bake for 15 min. Sprinkle cheese evenly over the top. Continue baking until browned and bubbling, about 15 more minutes. Serve warm.
