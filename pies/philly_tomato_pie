Add salt to dough and knead on medium speed until dough is satiny and sticky and clears sides of bowl but still sticks to bottom, 6-8 min.

Add garlic, oregano, and pepper flakes and cook until fragrant, ~30 s. Add tomato sauce and sugar and bring to a boil. Reduce heat to medium low and simmer until sauce is slightly thickened and measures ~1 1/4 c, ~10 min. Let sauce cool completely.
