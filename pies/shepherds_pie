Shepherd's Pie

Potato:
2 quarts diced yukon potato
5 oz cheddar cheese
8 egg yolks
1/3 c sliced chives
3 oz butter (room temp)
1 1/3 c heavy cream (warm)
salt

Peel and dice yukon potato making sure it's all the same size to ensure even cooking. Add potatoes to a large pot and cover with cold salted water. Simmer potatoes until soft and fully cooked. Strain potatoes, making sure potatoes are still warm, and add to a full sheet tray. Dry potatoes in oven at 300F for 10 min. Dice potato in a large bowl and add cheese, yolks, chives, butter, and cream. Mix until well incorporated. Season with salt.

Marinade:
1 bushel thyme, picked
1 bushel rosemary, picked
1 bushel oregano, picked
5 garlic cloves, peeled
1 c oil

Blend together the oil and garlic, add the herbs and emulsify.

Lamb:
2 lamb legs, roasted rare to medium rare

Cut the lamb into 1/2" chunks and rub liberally with the marinade. Sear briefly over high heat to caramelize the marinade, cooking as little as possible.

Sauce (veggies):
1/2 carrot, onion, celery, and leeks - diced to 1/4"
1 quart veal demi glaze
1/4 c slow roasted garlic puree

Saute the vegetables in butter over low heat till tender, no color. Add the garlic puree and stir to combine. Add the demi glaze and remove from the heat. Add the diced lamb and combine. Put the lamb and vegetables into an oven proof baking dish. Cover with the potato mixture and cooke at 425F till brown and crispy.
