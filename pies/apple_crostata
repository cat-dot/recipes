Apple Crostata
  --Ina Garten

Pastry:
1 c ap flour
2 tbsp granulated or superfine sugar
1/4 tsp kosher salt
1/4 lb (1 stick) very cold unsalted butter, diced
2 tbsp ice water

Place the flour, sugar, and salt in the bowl of a food processor fitted with a steel blade. Pulse a few times to combine. Add the butter and pulse 12-15 times, or until the butter is the size of peas. With the motor running, add the ice water all at once through the feed tube. Keep hitting the pulse button to combine, but stop the machine just before the dough becomes a solid mass. Turn the dough onto a well-floured board and form into a disk. Wrap with plastic and refrigerate for at least 1 hr. Preheat oven to 450F. Flour a rolling pin and roll the pastry into an 11" circle on a lightly floured surface. Transfer it to a baking sheet.


Filling:
1 1/2 lb McIntosh, Macoun, or Empire apples (3 large)
1/4 tsp grated orange zest
1/4 c flour
1/4 c granulated or superfine sugar
1/4 tsp kosher salt
1/4 tsp cinnamon
1/8 tsp ground allspice
4 tbsp (1/2 stick) cold unsalted butter, diced

Peel, core, and cut the apples into 8ths. Cut each wedge into 3 chunks. Toss the chunks with the orange zest. Cover the tart dough with the apple chunks leaving a 1 1/2" border. Combine the flour, sugar, salt, cinnamon, and allspice in the bowl of a food processor fitted with a steel blade. Add the butter and pulse until the mixture is crumbly. Pour into a bowl and rub it with your fingers until it starts holding together. Sprinkle evenly on the apples. Gently fold the border over the apples to enclose the dough, pleating it to make a circle. Bake the crostata for 20-25 min, until the crust is golden and the apples are tender. Allow to cool. Serve warm or at room temperature.
