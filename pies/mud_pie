12 oz milk chocolate chips
3/4 c heavy cream
1 tsp kosher salt

Espresso Whipped Cream
1 c heavy cream
1 tbsp confectioners' sugar
1/2 tsp instant espresso

In a large bowl, combine all the ingredients. Use an electric hand mixer, beat to stiff peaks. Spread over the chilled chocolate ganache. Chill the pie for 1 hr more.
