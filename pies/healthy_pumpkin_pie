Healthy Pumpkin Pie

Crust:
1 3/4 c blanched almond flour
1/4 tsp salt
4 tbsp ghee, melted and cooled

Preheat oven to 325F. In a bowl, combine all ingredients until well mixed. Press evenly into bottom and sides of a 9" pie tin. Bake until beginning to turn golden brown, ~15 min. Let cool

Filling:
15 oz can pumpkin puree
3 large eggs
1/2 c coconut milk
1/4 c maple syrup
1/4 c coconut sugar
2 tsp vanilla
1 1/2 tbsp speculaas spice blend or pumpkin pie spice blend
generous pinch of salt

In a large bowl, combine all ingredients and whisk by hand (or with electric mixer) until smooth and well mixed. Pour into cooled pie crust and bake until just set around edges but still slightly soft and jiggly in center and golden brown, 40-50 min. Let cool on a wire rack, then refrigerate for at least 3 hrs.
