Sour Cherry Pie

Crust:
2 1/2 c ap flour
1 tbsp sugar
3/4 tsp salt
1 c (2 sticks) chilled unsalted butter, cut into 1/2" cubes
5 tbsp + ice water

Whisk flour, sugar, and salt in large bowl to blend. Add butter and rub in with fingertips until small pea-sized clumps form. Add water, mix lightly with fork until dough holds together when small pieces are pressed between fingertips, adding more water if dry. Gather dough together; divide into 2 pieces. Form each into a ball, then flatten into a disk and wrap in plastic. Refrigerate at least 30 min. Can be made 2 days ahead. Let dough soften slightly before rolling out. Roll out 1 disk on floured surface to 12" round. Transfer to a 9" glass pie dish. Trim overhang to 1/2". Roll out second disk on floured surface to 12" round. Using large knife or pastry wheel with fluted edge, cut 10 3/4" wide strips. 

Filling:
1 c + 1 tbsp sugar
3 tbsp cornstarch
1/4 tsp salt
5 c whole pitted sour or dark sweet cherries (~2lbs unpitted)
1 tsp fresh lemon juice (if using sour cherries) or 3 tbsp (if using dark sweet cherries)
1/2 tsp vanilla
2 tbsp (1/4 stick) unsalted butter, cut into 1/2" cubes
1 tbsp milk

Position rack in lower third of oven and preheat to 425F. Whisk 1 c sugar, cornstarch, and salt in medium bowl to blend. Stir in cherries, lemon juice, and vanilla; set aside. Transfer filling to dough lined dish, mounding slightly in center. Dot with butter. Arrange strips atop filling, forming lattice; trim dough overhang to 1/2". Fold bottom crust up over ends of strips and crimp edges to seal. Brush lattice with milk. Sprinkle lattice with remaining 1 tbsp sugar. Place pie on rimmed baking sheet and bake 15 min. Reduce temp to 375F and bake until filling is bubbling and crust is golden brown, covering edges with foil collar if browning too quickly, ~ 1hr longer. Transfer to rack and cool completely.


Notes: some say 3/4 c sugar as it's too sweet
