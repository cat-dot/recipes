Apple Slab Pie
  --Cook's Country
  
8 granny smith apples (~3 1/2 lb) peeled, cored, and sliced thin
8 golden delicious apples (~3 1/2 lb) peeled, cored, and sliced thin
1 1/2 c granulated sugar, divided
1/2 tsp salt
1 1/2 c animal crackers (4 oz)
2x15 oz pillsbury ready to roll pie crust
4 tbsp unsalted butter, melted and cooled
6 tbsp minute tapioca
2 tsp cinnamon
3 tbsp lemon juice

Combine apples, 1 c sugar, and salt in colander set over large bowl. Let sit, tossing occasionally, until apples release their juices, ~30 min. Press gently on apples to extract liquid and reserve 3/4 c juice. Adjust oven rack to lower middle position and heat oven to 350F. Pulse crackers and remaining sugar in food processor until finely ground. Dust work surface with cracker mixture, brush half of one pie round with water, overlap with second pie round, and dust top with cracker mixture. Roll out dough to 19x14" and transfer to rimmed baking sheet (preferrably non-stick). Brush dough with butter and refrigerate; roll out top curst in the same way. Toss drained apples with tapioca, cinnamon, and lemon juice and arrange evenly over bottom crust, pressing lightly to flatten. Brush edges of bottom crust with water, and arrange top crust on pie. Press crusts together and use a paring knife to trim any excess dough. Use fork to crimp and seal edges of pie, then pierce top of pie at 2" intervals. Bake until pie is golden brown and juices are bubbling, ~1 hr. Transfer to wire rack and let cool 1 hr.

Glaze:
3/4 c reserved apple juice (from filling)
2 tbsp lemon juice
1 tbsp unsalted butter, softened
1 1/4 c confectioners' sugar

While pie is cooling, simmer reserved apple juice in saucepan over medium heat until syrupy and reduced to 1/4 c, ~6 min. Stir in lemon juice and butter and let cool to room temp. Whisk in sugar and brush glaze evenly over warm pie. Let pie cool completely, at least 1 hr. Serve.


Notes: Can be made up to 24 hrs in advanced and refrigerated. Bring to room temp before serving.
