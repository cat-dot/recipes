Chocolate Haupia Pie
  --Cook's Country

1 pie crust

Blind bake 20-30 min until crust is golden brown. Let cool for min 45 min.

Filling:
4 oz semi-sweet chocolate, chopped
12.5 oz can coconut milk
1 c whole milk
1/2 c (3 1/2 oz) sugar
1/4 c (1 oz) corn starch
1/8 tsp salt

Once crust has cooled completely, place chocolate in medium bowl; set aside. Whisk coconut milk, milk, sugar, cornstarch, and salt in medium saucepan until no lumps of cornstarch remain. Cook over medium heat, stirring and scraping saucepan corners constantly with rubber spatula, until mixture thickens to glue-like consistency and large bubbles break surface, ~6 min. Quickly pour 1 c coconut pudding over chocolate in bowl and whisk until smooth. Spread chocolate pudding evenly in cooled pie shell. Using clean, dry whisk, vigorously rewhisk remaining coconut pudding in saucepan, then gently pour on top of chocolate pudding and spread into even layer with rubber spatula. Refrigerate, uncovered, until set, at least 3 hrs or up to 24 hrs.
 
Topping:
1 c heavy cream, chilled
1 tbsp sugar

Once pie is fully chilled, use stand mixer fitted with whisk attachment to whip cream and sugar on medium-low speed until foamy, ~1 min. Increase speed to high and whip until stiff peaks form, 1-3 min. Transfer whipped cream to pastry bag fitted with medium open or closed star tip (~Â½" diameter). Pipe whipped cream stars onto top of pie until completely covered. Serve.
