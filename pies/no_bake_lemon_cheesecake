No Bake Lemon Cheesecake with Hazelnut Crust
  --Sur la Table

3/4 c hazelnuts, toasted
3/4 c graham cracker crumbs
3 tbsp confectioners’ sugar
5 tbsp unsalted butter, melted
1 packet (1 1/2 tsp) powdered unflavored gelatin
1/2 c lemon juice
1 1/2 lb (3x8oz packages) cream cheese, room temperature
3/4 c sugar
1 tsp vanilla paste
1/2 tsp lemon zest
1 c heavy whipping cream, whipped

In a food processor, fitted with a metal blade, place the hazelnuts, cracker crumbs, and confectioners’ sugar and process until finely ground, ~1 min. Pour in the melted butter and pulse until the crumbs are moist. Press the crumbs into an even layer across the bottom and ~halfway up the side of the a 9” springform pan, working outward from the center. Transfer the crust to the freezer and chill for at least 10 min, until firm. While the crust is chilling, make the filling. Sprinkle gelatin over the juice in a small saucepan or skillet and let stand for ~1 min. Place the saucepan on the stove over a low heat until the gelatin is completely dissolved. Set aside to cool slightly. In a stand mixer, fitted with a paddle attachment, add the cream cheese and sugar and beat on medium speed until very smooth, ~4 min. Lower the speed and add the gelatin, a little at a time, scraping down the sides of the bowl with a silicone spatula as necessary. Stir in the vanilla and zest, continuing to beat until just combined. Using a silicone spatula, fold in the whipped cream. Pour the filling into the frozen prepared crust and smooth the top with a spatula. Transfer to the refrigerator to set until firm, ~2-3 hr.


Notes: For individual cheesecakes divide the crust between 12 muffin tin cups lined with liners. Divide the batter between the cups. The setting time will also be reduced to 30-60 min
