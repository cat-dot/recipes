New York Cheesecake for Two
  --America's Test Kitchen
  
Crust:
3 whole graham crackers, broken into 1" pieces
3 tbsp unsalted butter, melted and cooled
1 tbsp sugar

Adjust oven rack to middle position and heat oven to 325F. Process graham cracker pieces in food processor to fine, even crumbs, ~30 s. Sprinkle 2 tbsp melted butter and sugar over crumbs and pulse to incorporate, ~5 pulses. Divide mixture evenly between two 4 1/2" springform pans. Using bottom of spoon, press crumbs firmly into even layer on bottom of pans, keeping sides as clean as possible. Bake crusts until fragrant and beginning to brown, ~10 min. Let crusts cool in pans on wire rack while making filling.

Filling:
10 oz cream cheese, softened
1/3 c (2 1/3 oz) sugar
pinch salt
4 tsp sour cream
1/2 tsp lemon juice
1/2 tsp vanilla extract
1 large egg + 1 large yolk

Increase oven temperature to 500F. Using hand-held mixer set at medium-low speed, beat cream cheese in large bowl until smooth, 1-2 min. Scrape down sides of bowl. Add 1/4 c sugar and salt and beat until combined, 30-60 s. Scrape down bowl, add remaining sugar, and beat until combined, 30-60 s. Scrape down bowl, add sour cream, lemon juice, and vanilla and beat until combined, 15-30 s. Scrape down bowl, add egg and egg yolk and beat until combined, 30-60 s. Being careful not to disturb baked crusts, brush inside of pans with remaining 1 tbsp melted butter and place pans on rimmed baking sheet. Pour filling evenly into cooled crusts, smooth tops, and bake cheesecakes for 2 min. Without opening oven door, reduce temperature to 200F and continue to bake until cakes register 150F, 12-17 min, rotating sheet halfway through baking. Let cheesecakes cool in pans on wire rack for 5 min, then run thin knife around edge of each cake. Let cakes continue to cool to room temperature,~1 hr. Wrap pans tightly in plastic wrap and refrigerate until cold, at least 2 hr or up to 4 days. To unmold cheesecakes, wrap hot dish towel around pans and let sit for 1 min. Remove sides of pans. Slide thin metal spatula between crusts and pan bottoms to loosen, then slide cakes onto individual serving plates. Let cakes sit at room temperature for 30 min.
