Spring Quiche with Asparagus, Gruyere, and Fontina
  --Ari Laing, Well Seasoned Studio

Crust:
2 1/2 c ap flour
1 tsp Kosher salt
1 c unsalted butter, room temperature
1/2 c ice water

Combine flour and salt in a large mixing bowl, then whisk. Add butter and incorporate into flour using a pastry cutter until butter pieces are the size of peas. Add 1/2 c water, then stir with a wooden spoon until the dough begins to clump together. Dump dough onto a lightly floured surface and knead with your hands for 1-2 min or until smooth and pliable. Wrap in plastic wrap, then let sit in fridge for 15-20 min to rest. When ready, preheat oven to 350F. Roll out dough on a lightly floured surface into a 15" circle, or ~3" wider than your quiche pan. Carefully transfer the dough to the pie pan, and then use your fingers to press onto the bottom and up the sides, crimping the edges over to line up evenly with the top. Use a fork to poke the bottom of the dough, ensuring it will bake flat. Bake for 20 minutes, and then set aside.

Filling:
6 large eggs
1 1/4 c heavy cream
1/2 tbsp kosher salt
1/2 tsp freshly ground black pepper
3 scallions, end trimmed and thinly sliced (about Â½ cup)
1 c fresh asparagus, cut into 1" pieces + more for top
1 c gruyere, grated
1/2 c fontina, thinly sliced
1/2 c parmesan, grated + 1 tbsp

Combine eggs, cream, salt, and pepper in a large mixing bowl, then whisk to combine. Add in scallions, 1 c asparagus, gruyere, fontina, and parmesan, reserving 1 tbsp. Stir together, and then pour into prepared quiche pan. Thinly slice a few pieces of reserved asparagus and lay on top of quiche. Sprinkle with remaining 1 tbsp parmesan, then bake for 45-50 min, or until browned and bubbly on top. Cover with foil to prevent burning, and then continue baking an additional 10 min. Let cool slightly before slicing. Serve immediately or at room temperature.
