Add the chile flakes and garlic, and cook until fragrant, 1-2 min more. Pour in the crushed tomatoes and the stock. Bring to a boil, then lower the heat to a simmer and cook until the liquid has slightly reduced, 20 min. Using a blender, puree the soup until smooth. Return to the pot and stir in the butter until emulsified. Season with salt and pepper, then keep warm until serving.
