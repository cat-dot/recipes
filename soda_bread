Irish Brown Soda Bread

1 c cake flour
2 c ap flour
1/2 c whole wheat flour
1/2 c wheat germ
2 tbsp dark brown sugar
2 tsp baking soda
1 1/2 tsp salt
1 tbsp chopped rosemary + 1 tbsp for garnish
1 2/3 c buttermilk
1 c golden raisins
2 tbsp melted butter

Preheat the oven to 400F. Lightly grease a 9" cast iron skillet. In a large bowl, combine the flours, wheat germ, sugar, baking soda, salt, and chopped rosemary. Create a well in the middle of the dry ingredients and pour in the buttermilk. Stir with a wooden spoon until just combined, then mix in the golden raisins into the dough. Use your hands to lightly knead the dough until a ball shape forms, making sure not to overmix, as this will toughen the bread. Place the ball of dough into the prepared skillet. Use a knife to score the top, cutting about 1/3 of the way through the dough in an X formation. Brush the top of the loaf with melted butter and sprinkle the remaining rosemary on top. Bake the bread until the crust is golden and the loaf is hollow when tapped, ~ 40min. Allow to cool completely before slicing and serving.
