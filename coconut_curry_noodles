Coconut Curry Noodles
  --Samantha Block, America's Test Kitchen

12 oz (1/4" wide) rice noodles
3 tbsp vegetable oil, divided
6 shallots, quartered 
1/4 c Thai red curry paste
14 oz can coconut milk 
2 tbsp fish sauce
4 large eggs
1/4 tsp table salt
1/4 tsp pepper
lime wedges
1/4 c chopped roasted cashews

Pour 4 qt boiling water over noodles in bowl and stir to separate. Let noodles soak until soft and pliable but not fully tender, stirring halfway through soaking, 8-10 min. Drain noodles and rinse with cold water until water runs clear, shaking to remove excess water; set aside. Heat 2 tbsp oil in 12" nonstick skillet over medium heat until shimmering. Add shallots and cook, stirring occasionally, until softened and starting to brown, ~5 min. Stir in curry paste and cook, mashing frequently, until fragrant, ~30 s. Stir in coconut milk and fish sauce, scraping up any fond, and bring to simmer. Add drained noodles, tossing to combine, and cook, tossing gently, until noodles are well coated and tender and sauce has thickened slightly, about 3 minutes. Transfer to serving bowl and cover with aluminum foil to keep warm. Wipe skillet clean with paper towels. Heat remaining 1 tbsp oil in now-empty skillet over medium-high heat until shimmering. Crack eggs into skillet and sprinkle with salt and pepper. Cover and cook for 1 min. Remove from heat and let sit for 15-45 s for runny yolks, 45-60 s for soft but set yolks, or ~2 min for medium-set yolks. Serve noodles with fried eggs and lime wedges, sprinkling individual portions with 1 tbsp cashews.
