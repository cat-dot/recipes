Short Rib Cottage Pie

Ribs:
3 tbsp unsalted butter
2 1/2 lbs boneless short ribs, small dice
kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper to taste
1/3 c ap flour 
2 garlic cloves, minced
1 medium yellow onion, thinly sliced
1 medium carrot, small dice
4 oz button mushrooms, quartered
2 1/2 c red wine, divided (preferrably a burgundy pino noir)
2 tsp chopped fresh rosemary
1 tsp chopped fresh thyme

In a 6 quart dutch oven, melt butter over medium high heat. Cook until it begins to brown, 2 min, then add the short ribs and season with salt and pepper. Cook, stirring as needed, until golden brown, 6-8 min. Using a slotted spoon, transfer the ribs to a bowl and toss with the flour to coat. Add the garlic, onions, and carrots to the pot, and sweat until they softene, 3-5 min. Add the mushrooms and cook another 2 min. Pour in 1/2 c of red wine, scraping the bottom to deglaze the pan. Cook until the liquid has evaporated and the vegetables begin to caramelize, 8-10 min. Add the reserved ribs, the remaining wine, and the herbs to the pot and bring to a simmer. Reduce the heat to low and cook, covered, until tender 45-55 min. Preheat the oven to 375F.

Potatoes:
2 lb (6 medium) yukon gold potatoes, peeled and cut into 2" pieces
1/2 c grated parmesan
5 garlic cloves, finely minced
1 1/2 sticks unsalted butter, softened

Bring a pot of salted water to a boil. Cook the potatoes until tender, 10-12 min. Drain the potatoes well and transfer to the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with the paddle attachment, Whip the potatoes until smooth and no longer steaming, 5-7 min, then add the remaining ingredients and mix until incorporated.

Spread the ribs evenly in a 9" pie dish. Top with the potatoes and place on a baking sheet. Bake until the potatoes begin to caramelize, 20-25 min. Let cool slightly, then serve.
