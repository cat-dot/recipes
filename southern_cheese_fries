  --Cook's Country

8 oz shredded extra sharp cheddar cheese (~2 c)
1 1/2 c (7 1/2 oz) ap flour
8 tbsp unsalted butter, cut into 8 pieces and chilled
3/4 tsp salt
3/4 tsp paprika
1/2 tsp baking powder
1/4 cayenne pepper
3 tbsp ice water

Adjust oven rack to middle position and heat oven to 350 F. Line rimmed baking sheet with parchment paper. Process cheese, flour, butter, salt, paprika, baking powder, and cayenne in food processor until mixture resembles wet sand, ~20 s. Add ice water and process until dough ball starts to form, ~25 s. Turn out the dough onto lightly floured surface. Knead briefly until dough fully comes together, 2-3 turns. Using your hands, pat dough into rough 4" square. Roll dough into 10" square, ~1/4" thick, flouring surface as needed to prevent sticking. Position dough so 1 edge is parallel to edge of counter. Using rounded side of fork, drag tines across entire surface of dough to make decorative lines. Using pizza cutter or knife, trim away and discard outer 1/2" of dough to make neat square. Cut dough into 3 equal pieces perpendicular to decorative lines. Working with 1 section of dough at a time, cut into 1/2" wide strips in direction of lines. Evenly space cheese straws on prepared sheet, ~1/2" apart. Bake until edges of straws are light golden brown, 30-35 min, rotating sheet halfway thorugh baking. Let straws cool completely on sheet. Serve. Can store in airtight container at room temp for up to 1 week.
