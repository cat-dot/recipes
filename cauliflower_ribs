Braised Greens and Cauliflower Ribs with Piave Bacon Breadcrumbs

1 c fresh breadcrumbs
2 tbsp evoo, divided
2 oz slab bacon, finely chopped (~1/3c)
1 bunch rainbow swiss chard, leaves and ribs separated, and ribs sliced into 2" pieces
Ribs and leaves from one cauliflower, cleaned and ribs thinly sliced
750 ml bottle dry white wine
1 tbsp finely grated piave cheese
1 stick unsalted butter
salt and freshly ground black pepper
freshly squeezed lemon juice

Preheat oven to 350F. Spread the bread crumbs evenly on a sheet pan, drizzle with 1 tbsp of oil and place in the oven. Bake until browned and toasted, ~10-15 min, stirring once or twice. Remove from the oven and set aside to cool. In a medium skillet over medium high heat, cook the bacon, stirring frequently, until browned and crisp, ~7-10 min. Remove the bacon from the pan and set aside to cool. Add the chard ribs, cauliflower ribs, and the remaining 1 tbsp of oil to the pan, set over medium heat and cook for 5 min. Add 1/2 c of the wine and cook, stirring frequently, until the ribs are tender and the liquid has evaporated, ~20-25 min. Remove the pan from the heat and reserve. In a medium bowl, combine the cooled bread crumbs, pave, and bacon and set aside. In a medium stockpot, combine the remaining wine with enough water to fill the pan 3/4 of the way up the sides and bring to a boil. Add the butter and season generously with salt. Once the butter has melted, add the chard leaves, cauliflower leaves, and reserved ribs and cook until the greens are wilted and the ribs are tender, ~2-3 min. Drain and seaosn with salt and pepper. Transfer the vegetables to a serving dish, drizzle with a few drops of lemon juice and top with the bread crumb mixture. Serve immediately.
