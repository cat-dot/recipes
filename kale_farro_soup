Oprah's Kale and Farro Soup

1 tbsp olive oil
1 small yellow onion, finely chopped
1 leek, white and light green parts only, halved—rinsed and thinly sliced
2 medium carrots, diced
2 celery stalks, diced
2 garlic cloves, minced
2 c pearled farro, rinsed and drained
1 lb (2 cups) peeled butternut squash, cut into ½" cubes
8 c chicken stock
14oz can diced tomatoes
3" Parmesan rind, plus freshly grated Parmesan, for garnish
1 bay leaf
1 tsp dried thyme
Kosher salt and freshly ground pepper, to taste
1 bunch (6 oz) green curly kale, stems removed and leaves roughly chopped

In a large saucepan, heat the olive oil over medium heat. Add the onion and leek, and cook until softened, 4 min. Add the carrots and celery, and cook until beginning to soften, another 4 min. Add the garlic and cook until fragrant, 1 min. Stir in the farro, followed by the squash, chicken stock, tomatoes, Parmesan rind, bay leaf, thyme, salt and pepper. Bring to a light simmer and cook, partially covered, until the farro and squash are tender, 30-35 min. Stir in the kale and cook until tender, 2 min more. Adjust the seasoning with salt and pepper, then divide between bowls. Garnish with freshly grated Parmesan and serve.
