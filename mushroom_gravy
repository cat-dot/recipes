Mushroom Gravy
  --Kaiser

1 tbsp evoo
10 oz cremini mushrooms, wiped clean, stemmed, and cut into thin slices
2 medium shallots, finely chopped
1 garlic clove, finely chopped
4 sage leaves, minced
2 sprigs thyme, leaves minced
1-2 tbsp dry sherry (optional)
1/4 tsp red pepper flakes
Scant 1/8 tsp ground clove
1 tbsp low-sodium soy sauce
1 tbsp maple syrup
1 tbsp unsalted butter
1 tbsp ap flour
1 1/4 c whole or reduced-fat milk
Zest and juice of 1/2 small lemon

Heat a saute pan over medium heat and add the olive oil. When hot, add the mushrooms and cook until softened and starting to brown, ~2-3 min. Add shallots and garlic to the mushrooms. Stir to combine. When the shallots are translucent and softened, add the sage, thyme, and sherry, if using, and cook until the liquid is almost evaporated. Pour the mushroom mixture into the bowl of a food processor and add the red pepper flakes, clove, soy sauce, and maple syrup. Pulse to combine. Place the pan back over medium heat and add the butter. After it melts and the foaming subsides, add the flour and stir constantly until the roux (butter plus flour) is lightly brown and fragrant, ~3-4 min. Add the milk slowly, whisking to combine. The mixture may look clumpy at first but keep whisking until smooth. Heat until the edges are bubbling and the mixture thickens slightly. Pour milk mixture into the food processor and pulse until well combined. Add the lemon zest and juice and pulse some more. A slightly chunky texture is good. Taste and adjust seasoning with salt or lemon juice as needed. Return mushroom gravy to the pan over low heat and keep warm until ready to serve.
