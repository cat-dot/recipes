Vegan Green Curry
  --Andrea Soranidis
  
1 small head of purple cauliflower, cut into florets
2 tbsp evoo
1 garlic clove, grated
1 tsp fresh ginger, grated
1/2 white onion, finely sliced
1 yellow bell pepper, finely sliced
5 oz oyster mushrooms, roughly chopped (150 g)
1 zucchini, roughly cubed
2 oz snow peas, (60 g)
1 tbsp vegan Thai green curry paste
2 tsp organic brown sugar
2 oz fresh or frozen peas, (60 g)
1 can organic coconut milk, (13.66 fl oz/ 400 ml)
1 tbsp gluten-free tamari sauce
1/2 lemon grass
1/2 red Thai chilli, finely sliced (optional)
1/2 lime
1 tbsp fresh coriander, finely chopped

In a large pot of lightly salted boiling water cook the cauliflower florets for 5 min or until just tender. Heat a large wok or cast iron skillet with the evoo over medium heat. Add in the garlic, ginger, onion, bell pepper, oyster mushrooms, zucchini and snow peas, and stir-fry all the veggies for 2 min. Add in the curry paste and sugar and cook for another min. Drain the cauliflower florets and fold them together with the peas into the pan with the other veggies, and cook for 5 more min. Pour in the coconut milk and tamari sauce, and add in the lemongrass. Cook for 5 min, then remove the lemongrass. If the curry is too thick, add a splash of water, and adjust seasoning to taste. Remove the pot from the heat, squeeze half lime over the top, and sprinkle the fresh coriander and red chilli (if using) all over the curry. Serve with your favorite steamed rice.


Notes: Found that more curry paste was needed for flavor
