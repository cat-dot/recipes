Amaretti Mascarpone Pancakes

3 1/4 c ap flour
2/3 c granulate sugar
2 tsp baking powder
1 tsp baking soda
1/2 tsp kosher salt
1 3/4 c whole milk
1/2 c mascarpone
1/2 c buttermilk
5 tbsp unsalted butter, melted and divided
1 tsp amaretto
1 tsp vanilla
5 eggs, separated
1 c crushed amaretti cookies + more for garnish

In a medium bowl, whisk together the flour, sugar, baking powder, baking soda, and salt until incorporated and set aside. In a large bowl, whisk together the milk, mascarpone, buttermilk, 1 tbsp of butter, amaretto, vanilla, and egg yolks until smooth. Slowly fold the dry ingredients into the wet. Using an electric hand mixer, beat the egg whites to stiff peaks, then carefully fold them into the batter, along with the cookies. In a medium nonstick skillet, heat 1/2 tbsp of butter over medium heat. Add 1/2 c of the batter to the pan and cook, flipping once, until golden brown and fluffy, 1-2 min per side. Add more butter as needed when cooking the remaining pancakes. Garnish with amaretti cookies and serve with maple syrup.
