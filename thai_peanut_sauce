Thai Peanut Sauce
  --Tiffany (Don't waste the crumbs)

¼ c peanut butter
2 tbsp rice vinegar
2 tbsp lime juice (about 1½ limes)
3 tbsp olive oil
1 tbsp soy sauce (I use liquid aminos)
1 tsp salt
¼ tsp crushed red pepper
1" fresh ginger, sliced
1 tbsp minced garlic (about 2-3 garlic cloves)
1 tbsp sugar
2 tbsp honey
¼ c cilantro

Add all the ingredients, except the cilantro, to the blender or food processor. Blend until all the ingredients are smooth and creamy. Add the cilantro and pulse until the cilantro is in very small pieces.


Notes: if using for a dressing, better results if you put cilantro on salad instead.
