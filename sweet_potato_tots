Sweet Potato Chickpea Tots

3 medium sized sweet potatoes, peeled and coarsley shredded
2 cups cooked chickpeas (if using dried, cook and save the liquid. If using canned, don't drain the liquid)
1/2 c fresh green onion, chopped
2 cloves garlic, minced
1 tsp smoked paprika
1/2 tsp onion powder
1/4 c fresh parsley, chopped
salt to taste

Preheat oven to 350F. Place the shredded potatoes on a lined baking sheet and bake for 20 min, until tender. Do not overcook. Once the potatoes are done, increase oven temp to 400F. In a food processor, puree the chickpeas with their liquid until smooth. In a medium mixing bowl, combine the shredded sweet potatoes, pureed chickpeas, green onions, spices, and salt. Cover and refrigerate for 45 min to make the tots easier to form. Using a cookie scoop, form the tots and place on lined baking sheet. Gently flatten. Bake for 10-12 min or until lightly browned. 
Can last 10 days in fridge and up to 6 months in the freezer.
