Sailor's Beef Stew (sjomansbiff)

2 1/2lbs topside beef with fat cap, cut into 8-10 generous 1/2" slices
1/2 ap flour for dusting
2 tbsp unsalted butter + more as needed
6 medium (2lbs) waxy potatoes (i.e. yukon gold) peeld and cut into 1/2" rounds
2 medium whole onions
2x12oz bottles pilsner beer 
2 bay leaves
4 c low sodium beef stock
kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper
1/2 c chopped fresh parsley to server
assorted picked vegetables to serve

Preheat oven to 300F and line a baking sheet with parchment paper. Working in batches, place 3 beef slices in between 2 large pieces of parchment paper and pound with a mallet or heavy saucepan until 1/8" thick. Repeat until all of the slices are pounded. Set aside. Pour the flour onto a large plate. Turn each slice of beef in the flour, coating both sides, and place in a singler layer on the prepared baking sheet. In a large wide dutch oven, heat the butter over medium high heat. Working in batches, add a single layer of beef slices and brown both sides, flipping once, 4 min per side. Transfer the beef to a large plate and repeat with the remainig, adding more butter as needed. Set aside. Add the potatoes to the dutch oven and saute until golden brown, 10 min. Return the browned beef to the pot, along with the onions, and pour the beer over the top. Add the bay leaves and enough stock to barely cover the meat and potatoes. Season with a generous pinch of salt and freshly ground black pepper. Cover and bring to a simmer, then transfer to the oven and braise until the meat is tender, 1 1/2 - 2hrs.
