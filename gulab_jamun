Dough:
1 c milk powder
1/2 c ap flour (Maida)
1/2 tsp baking powder
2 tbsp melted butter
1/4 c whole milk
oil for frying (vegetable, or 50/50 with ghee)

Combine milk powder, flour, and butter in a bowl and mix well to combine. Add the milk until the dough becomes firm. Continue to stir the ingredients until you create a nice thick and creamy substance. If the dough is not creamy enough, add more milk until the dough is smooth and creamy. Divide the dough into small portions. Grease your hands with oil or ghee. Roll each portion into a ball, trying to make as smooth as possible, placing on a plate. Heat oil on high; when it's hot, reduce to medium low. Slip the balls in one at a time, being careful to not splash hot oil. Let the dough balls sink to the bottom of the pan. Fry for ~3 min until golden. Place fried balls on a paper towel to absorb the grease. 

Syrup:
2 c sugar
1 c water
4-5 cardamom pods
5 tbsp rosewater
saffron (optional)

Heat all ingredients in a pan for 5 min. Stir well to combine. Do not overheat or the syrup will turn into caramel. Transfer warm syrup to serving bowl. Lower the balls into the syrup and let sit for at least 1-2 hr. Make sure the dough balls are completely covered.
