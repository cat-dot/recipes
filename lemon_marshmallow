Lemon Marshmallows

1/4 c + 1 tsp (2 1/4oz or 65g) cold water, divided
2 tbsp (1 oz or 30g) fresh lemon juice, divided
1 1/2 tsp (1/4oz or 7g) unflavored powdered gelatin (1 packet)
3/4 c (5 1/2oz or 150g) granulated suagr
1/3 c (3 1/2 oz or 100g) light corn syrup
zest of 1 medium lemon
1/2 c (4 1/4oz or 120g) cornstarch
1/2 c (2 1/4oz or 62g) confectioners' sugar

Spray an 8x8" baking pan or quarter sheet pan with nonstick cooking spray. In the bowl of a stand mixer, combine 1 tbsp + 2 tsp of the water and juice. Sprinkle the gelatin over the top and set aside for 5 min. In a small saucepan over high heat, combine the remaining 2 tbsp + 2 tsp of the water with the sugar and corn syrup. Bring the mixture to a boil and cook until it reaches 240F on a candy thermometer, about 15min. Remove the pan from the heat and set aside until it cools to 200F, ~ `min. Using the mixer set on low, whisk the gelatin for 10s. With the mixer set to medium-high speed, carefully pour in the hot syrup, whisking until the mixture is very thick, fluffy, and nearly cool, 8-10min. Add the lemon zest and whisk just to combine. Remove the bowl from the mixer and scrape the marshmallow into the prepared pan, spreading it into an even layer (the marshmallow should be about 1" thick). Set aside, uncovered, at room temp until firm and set, ~1 hr. Spray the top of the marshmallow lightly with cooking spray and cover with plastic wrap. Leave at room temp or chill overnight. In a large bowl, whisk together the cornstarch and confectioners' sugar. Sift a few tbsps of the mixture over the top of the marshmallow and lightly spread it into a thin, even coating. Carefully invert the marshmallow onto a cutting board and sift a few tbsps of the cornstarch mixture over the top side. With a knife, pizza cutter, or cookie cutter, cut the marshmallow into desired shapes and place in the bowl with the remaining cornstarch mixture. Toss to coat evenly. Transfer a few to a fine-mesh strainer and shake gently to remvoe excess. Place in an airtight container. Can be stored at room temp for up to 3 weeks.
