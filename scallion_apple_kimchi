Scallion Apple Kimchi

1 lb green onions, trimmed and cut into thirds (7 c)
8 oz daikon radish, julienned (2 c)
1 lb red apples, peeled, cored, and quartered (2 medium)
1 farlic head, peeled and cloves separated
3" piece ginger
1/2 c gochujang
1/4 c shoyu
1/4 c sugar
2 tbsp fish sauce
2 tbsp salted fermented shrimp (saeujeot)
1 tbsp kosher salt

In a large mixing bowl, combine the green onions and daikon and set aside. In the bowl of a food processor, add the remaining ingredients and puree to a paste. Wearing gloves, add the paste to the green onions and gently massage into the greens, gently crushing them to help release their juices. Place the mixture in a 1 gallon fermentation glass jar, pressing the contents down and eliminating any air pockets. Cover with cheesecloth and store in a cool, dark place for 4 days, occasionally removing the cheesecloth to pack down and submerge the contents of the jar in its own liquid. After 4 days, affix tight-fitting lid and store in the fridge for a minimum of 1 week and up to a few months.
