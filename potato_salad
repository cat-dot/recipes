Dante's Potato Salad

1/4 c + 1 tbsp olive oil, divided
1 large spanish onion, diced
4 lb yukon gold or other waxy potatoes
kosher salt and freshly ground pepper to taste
2 tbsp whole grain mustard
1/4 c cider vinegar
pinch of cayenne pepper
3 tbsp finely chopped chives

In a large skillet over medium low heat, warm 1 tbsp of the oil. Add the onion and cook, stirring often, until translucent and just tender, 8-10 min. Transfer to a bowl and let cool. In a large saucepan, cover the potatoes with water by 1" and season generously with salt. Bring to a boil, reduce the heat to a simmer and cook until the potatoes are tender, 25-30 min. Drain the potatoes and tranfer to a cutting board. In a large mixing bowl, whisk together the mustard, vinegar, and cayenne. Slowly whisk in the remaining oil. Season with salt and pepper. When the potatoes are cool enough to handle, cut them into 1/2" dice. Toss the warm potatoes and onions with the vinaigrette. Ad the chives, season with salt and pepper, and toss again. Serve immediately or refrigerate for up to 1 day.
