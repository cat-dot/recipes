  --Anna, Kore Kamino

Wrappers:
2 c unbleached ap flour
pinch salt
enough water to form dough

Mix ingredients together in a bowl until a rough dough forms. Knead the dough and form into a ball. Cover with plasitc wrap and let rest for 1 hr.

Filling:
3/4 c any type of vegetables finely chopped (carots, potatoes, cabbage, etc)
3/4 c another type of vegetable(s) finely chopped (broccoli, long beans, cauliflower, etc.)
1/2 lb (250g) ground chicken (or turkey)
1 medium onion, finely shredded
1/2 tbsp black pepper
1/2 tbsp tumeric
1 1/2 tbsp cinnamon
1 tbsp curry powder
1/2 c vegetable oil
salt & chili to taste

Add chopped veggies to boiling water, turn down heat and let simmer for 3 min; drain. Mix all other ingredients thoroughly in a bowl, then add cooled veggies and combine. 

Assembly:
Roll dough to even thickness of ~2mm. With a cookie/biscuit cutter or cup, cut dough into 3" rounds. Put a scoop of filling on half of each round, fold in half and seal edges. Make sure seal is tight and no filling will pop out. Coat surface of steamer rack with oil so that the momos won't stick. Place momos on rack so they are not touching. MAke sure water is boiling before putting filled rack in. Steam momos for 6 min.


Tomato Chutney:
1 lb (1/2 kg) tomatoes
1 c fresh cilantro, chopped
juice 1/2 lemon
salt to taste
1/8" fresh ginger, chopped
4 cloves chopped garlic
1/2 tsp red pepper (or tobasco)
1 tsp black pepper
1 tsp vegetable oil
1/4 tsp carvi or fenugreek seeds
1/4 tsp mustard seeds

Preheat oven to 450F; place washed tomatoes on a baking sheet and bake for 30 min, or until they look cooked and their skins are dark. Blend tomatoes in a belnder with salt, peppers, lemon juice, cilantro, ginger, and garlic. Heat oil and fry seeds until they turn black. Stir into tomato mixture and give a last blend. 



Notes; the thinner the dough, the lighter the momos, just be careful not to make it too thin so they tear.
