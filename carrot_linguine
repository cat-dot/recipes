Carrot Linguine with Carrot Top Pesto

Pickled Carrots:
4 small, multicolored carrots, peeled and thinly sliced lengthwise with a mandoline
½ c white wine vinegar
½ c water
2 tbsp granulated sugar
1 tbsp kosher salt
1 tsp coriander seeds
½ tsp cumin seeds
1 bay leaf
Pinch red pepper flakes

Place the sliced carrots in a small, heatproof bowl. In a small saucepan, combine the remaining pickled carrot ingredients over high heat and bring to a boil. Cook until the sugar dissolves, 1 min, then pour over the sliced carrots. Make sure the carrots are fully submerged in the pickling liquid, then let cool completely.

Pesto:
1 c carrot tops, plus more for garnish
½ c basil leaves
2 tbsp pine nuts, toasted
2 tbsp freshly grated Parmesan, plus more for garnish
1 tbsp lemon juice
1 tsp lemon zest
2 garlic cloves, roughly chopped
Pinch red pepper flakes
½ c olive oil
kosher salt, to taste

In a food processor, combine the carrot tops, basil, pine nuts, Parmesan, lemon juice and zest, garlic and red pepper flakes. Pulse until combined and finely minced. With the motor running, slowly pour in the olive oil until a smooth pesto forms, scraping the sides as needed. Season with salt and set aside.

Linguine:
¼ c olive oil
3 garlic cloves, thinly sliced
Pinch red pepper flakes
1 lb dried linguine
4 c carrot juice
kosher salt, to taste

 In a 12", high-sided skillet, heat the olive oil, garlic and red pepper flakes over medium heat. Cook until the garlic is sizzling and lightly golden, 2-3 min. Add the pasta and carrot juice, then bring to a boil over medium-high heat. Cook, stirring often, until the pasta is al dente and the juice has reduced into a thick sauce that coats the noodles, 10-12 min. Season with salt.
 
 Divide the pasta between plates and top with the carrot-top pesto and pickled carrots. Garnish with carrot-top leaves and grated Parmesan, then serve.
