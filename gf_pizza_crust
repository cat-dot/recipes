Gluten Free Pizza Crust

2 1/2 c rice flour
2/4 oz gf quick-rise yeast
1 tsp salt
1/2 tsp xantham gum
3 tbsp olive oil
1 1/2 c warm water, divided (~120-130F)
1 tbsp honey
cornmeal (optional)

Combine flour, yeast, salt, and xantham gum in a large bowl. Stir in 1 c water, olive oil, and honey. Use hands to work dough (dough will be soft and crumbly). Add just enough of the remaining water to hold mixture together. Knead dough in bowl 5 min. Cover, let rest 10 min. Lightly grease 12/; pizza pan, sprinkle with cornmeal, if desired. Flatten dough into round disk; press dough into pan. Add sauce and desired toppings. Bake in 425F oven for 20-30 min or until crust is brown and cheese is melted.

Variation: add 1 tbsp chopped fresh basil and 2 cloved minced garlic after honey.
Note: can sub milk/nut milk for the water for a different (somewhat preferred) taste if no vegan/dairy free requirement
