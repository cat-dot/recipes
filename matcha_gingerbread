Matcha Gingerbread Cookies

1 c sweet rice flour
1/2 c finely ground almond flour
1/2 c chestnut flour
1 1/2 tsp matcha tea, divided
3/4 tsp baking soda
1 tsp ground cinnamon
1 tsp kosher salt
1/4 tsp ground allspice
1/4 tsp freshly ground black pepper
2/3 c + 1/2 c sugar, divided
1/3 c mashed avocado (1/2 medium avocado)
1/3 c olive oil
2 tbsp grated fresh ginger
1 tsp vanilla
1/2 c roughly chopped candied ginger

Preheat oven to 375F. In a medium bowl, whisk together the flours, 1 tsp of the matcha tea, baking soda, cinnamon, salt, allspice, and pepper and set aside. In a large bowl, beat 2/3 c of sugar with the avocado, olive oil, fresh ginger, and vanilla until creamy and smooth, 2 min. Beat the flour mixture into the sugar mixture in 2 additions and, when almost combined, stir in the candied ginger. The dough will be thick and tacky. Combine the remaining sugar and matcha on a large plate. Divide the dough into 12 even pieces and roll into a ball. Press each ball into the matcha sugar and clatten to 1/4" thick disc, coating the bottom and sides with the sugar. Place onto a lined baking sheet, sugar side up. Bake, rotating halfway through, for 8-10 min. Let cool on the sheet for at least 5 min before remiving.
