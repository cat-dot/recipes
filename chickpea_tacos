6 corn or flour tortillas
15 oz can chickpeas, rinsed and drained
1/2 tsp ancho chili powder
3 c shredded creen cabbage
1 c shredded carrot
1/2 c thinly sliced red onion
1/2 c seeded and small diced poblano pepper
1/2 c sliced green onion
1/4 c chopped fresh cilantro
1/4 c tofu cashew mayo
2 tbsp lime juice
1/4 tsp salt
1 avocado, pitted and sliced
1 tbsp sriracha (optional)

Preheat oven to 375F. Shape tortillas by placing them in a nonstick oven safe-bowl and baking them in the oven until crispy, 5-10 min. In a large mixing bowl, smash the chickpeas with a fork and sprinkle with the chili powder. Add the cabbage, carrot, red onion, poblano pepper, green onion, cilantro, mayo, and lime juice. Mix thoroughly, adding salt last. Divide the salad mixture among the taco bowls and top with the sliced avocado. Add sriracha if you like.

Tofu Cashew Mayonnaise

1/4 c raw cashews, soaked in water to cover for 2-3 hrs, then drained
7 oz extra firm tofu
1/2 tsp sea salt
1/2 tsp tahini
4 tsp lemon juice
1 1/2 tsp white vinegar
1 tbsp dijon mustard
2 tbsp apple cider vinegar
2 1/2 tsp agave nectar
2 tbsp water
1/4 tsp xantham gum (optional)

Soaking the cashews in water for a few hours will reduce blending time. If you are not using a vitamix, it's highly recommended to soak. Place all ingredients in vitamix and blend until smooth and shiny.
