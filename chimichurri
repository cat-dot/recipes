Chimichurri
  --Karina, cafedelites.com
  
1/2 c olive oil
2 tbsp red wine vinegar
1/2 c finely chopped parsley
3-4 cloves garlic , finely chopped or minced
2 small red chilies , or 1 red chili, deseeded and finely chopped (~1 tbsp finely chopped chili)
3/4 tsp dried oregano
1 level tsp coarse salt
pepper , to taste (~1/2 tsp)

Mix all ingredients together in a bowl. Allow to sit for 5-10 min to release all of the flavours into the oil before using. Ideally, let it sit for more than 2 hr, if time allows. Typically you baste meat with it, not really a marinade.
