  --Cook's Illustrated

15 oz can unsweetened pumpkin puree
2 tsp pumpkin pie spice
1/2 tsp salt
15 whole graham crackers, broken into 1" pieces
1/4 c (1 3/4 oz) + 1 1/3 c (9 1/3 oz) sugar
1 tsp ground ginger
8 tbsp unsalted butter, melted
1 lb cream cheese, softened
1 tbsp lemon juice
2 tsp vanilla extract
4 large eggs, room temperature

Combine pumpkin, pumpkin pie spice, and salt in small saucepan. Cook mixture, stirring constantly, over medium heat until reduced to 1 1/2 c, 6-8 min; let cool for 1 hr. Adjust oven rack to middle position and heat oven to 325 F. Make foil sling for 13x9" baking pan. Grease aluminum foil. Process graham crackers, 1/4 c sugar, and ginger in food processor to fine crumbs, ~15 s. Add butter and pulse until combined, ~5 pulses. Sprinkle mixture into prepared pan and press into even layer. Bake until just starting to brown, 15-18 min. Let crust cool completely on wire rack. Using stand mixer fitted with paddle, beat cream cheese and remaining 1 1/3 c sugar on medium-low speed until smooth, ~2 min. Add lemon juice, vanilla, and pumpkin mixture and beat until combined. Increase speed to medium; add eggs, one at a time; and beat until incorporated. Pour over cooled crust and spread into even layer. Bake until edges are slightly puffed and center is just set, 45-50 min. Let cheesecake cool in pan on wire rack for 2 hr. Cover pan with plastic wrap and refrigerate cheesecake for at least 3 hr or up to 24 hr. Using foil overhang, lift cheesecake out of pan. Cut into 24 pieces before serving.
