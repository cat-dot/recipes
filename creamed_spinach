Creamed Kohlrabi and Spinach

3 tsp canola oil divided
3 small kohlrabi bulbs (3/4-1lb) out skin peeled and flesh thinly sliced into rounds
1/4 tsp kosher salt + more to taste
3 medium shallots, peeled, halved, and thinly sliced
4 large garlic cloves, peeled, halved, and thinly sliced
3/4 c cashew milk
12 packed cups spinach leaves
2 tsp lime juice
1/3 c roasted cashews, chopped
1/2 c finely grated shredded parmesan cheese

Preheat oven to 450F. Cook the kohlrabi in 3-4 batches. In a large cast iron skillet, add 1/2 tsp of canola oil and place over high heat. When the oil is very hot, add a layer of kohlrabi and saute, stirring sparingly, until the kohlrabi has softened and a few rounds are golden brown on the edges, 2 min. Transfer to a large bowl and continue to cook the remaining kohlrabi (not adding any extra oil). Remove from the heat and season with salt; set aside. To the large skillet, add the remaining 2 1/2 tsp of oil and return to medium high heat. Add the shallots and cook until softened and light golden brown, 4 min. Add the garlic and cook until golden brown, 2 more min. Season with a pinch of salt and add to the bowl of kohlrabi. Return the skillet to medium high heat and deglaze with the cashew milk, cooking until reduced by about half, 3-5 min. Add half of the spinach leaves, flipping with tongs to cook evenly until they begin to wil, about 2 min. Add the remaining spinach and cook until most of the liquid has reduced and the leaves are wilted, 2 min more. Remove from the heat and stir in the kohlrabi mixture and lime juice. Adjust the seasoning to taste with salt. Evenly sprinkle the cashews over the the mixture and top with the parmesan. Transfer to the oven and bake until the cheese is melted, 5-8 min. Server immediately.
