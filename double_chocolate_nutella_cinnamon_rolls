Double Chocolate Nutella Cinnamon Rolls
  --Sandra Dash of Sanity
  
Rolls:
4 tbsp butter melted
4 tbsp water
1/4 c instant chocolate pudding
1/4 c dutch process cocoa powder
1 c milk
1 egg beaten
1 tbsp sugar
1/2 tsp salt
4 c flour (bread flour is preferred)
2 1/2 tsp active dry yeast

Combine yeast, water and sugar in a small bowl. Let it sit at room temperature for 5-10 min until foamy. In a large bowl add all ingredients, beginning with dry ingredients and ending with the wet ingredients. Knead this all together until well combined, 8-12 min. Cover bowl with a dry dish towel and allow to rise until doubled, ~60-90 min. Remove dough onto floured surface, punch down to get rid of all the bubbles and roll out to a rectangle ~17x10".

Filling:
1/2 c sugar
2 tsp cinnamon
1 c Nutella

In a small bowl combine the sugar and the cinnamon, set aside. Spread the Nutella on the rolled out dough, make sure to cover the dough entirely. Sprinkled cinnamon and sugar mixture over the Nutella. Roll the dough tightly from long end, pinching edges closed when completely rolled. Slice dough into 12 rolls, ~3/4-1" thick slices. Place into greased 9Ã—13" pan, let rise until doubled, I always get impatient at this point and will let it rise for 30 min then bake. Bake at 350F for 20-22 min. Prepare glaze while baking if serving immediately.

Glaze:
2 c powdered sugar
4 tbsp butter softened, close to melting
1 tbsp cocoa powder
4 tbsp hot water
1/2-1 tsp vanilla

Mix butter, powdered sugar, cocoa powder, and vanilla extract. Add hot water 1 tbsp at a time until the glaze reaches desired consistency. Drizzle over sweet rolls after they have cooled for a few minutes. Serve immediately. If serving later, set the rolls aside and glaze when ready to serve. 



Notes: Can make dough in bread machine. Place ingredients as listed in order above into a bread machine. Set for dough cycle. After complete on dough cycle, remove from machine and roll out to a rectangle ~17x10".
