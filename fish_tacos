Beer-Battered Fish Tacos
  - Ludo Lefebvre

Chipotle Mayo:
1 c mayo
1 c sour cream
2 tbsp lemon juice
7 oz can chipotle chiles in adobo
kosher salt to taste

In a blender, combine all the chipotle mayo ingredients and blend until smooth. Makes 2½ c.

Fish:
grapeseed or vegetable ooil for frying
1½ c flour, divided
2 tsp kosher salt + more to taste
12 oz Mexican beer (i.e. Negra Modelo)
2 lb halibut fillets, cut into 4x1+ strips

In a medium Dutch oven, heat 2" of oil to 375° and line a plate with paper towels. In a medium bowl, whisk together 1 c of the flour with the salt and beer until a smooth batter forms. Sprinkle the remaining flour over the halibut strips and toss to coat. One at a time, shake off the excess flour, dip the strips into the batter, and then drop them into the fryer. Fry, 4 pieces at a time, until golden brown and cooked through, 2-3 min. Transfer each piece of halibut to the prepared plate to drain, seasoning with salt as soon as it's out of the fryer. Repeat the frying process in batches until all the halibut is fried.

Assembly:
12 small flour tortillas, warmed
fried halibut
chipotle mayo
¾ c shredded red cabbage
½ red onion, minced
½ c corn tortilla chips, crushed
¼ c salsa or pico de gallo
Hot sauce, for serving
Lime wedges, for serving

Lay out the tortillas on a cutting board and top each with 1 to 2 pieces of halibut, depending on the size. Drizzle each piece with some chipotle mayo and top with red cabbage, red onion, crushed tortilla chips and salsa. Serve with hot sauce (if you need more heat) and lime wedges.
