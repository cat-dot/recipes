Masala Chai

Spice Mix:
5 cinnamon sticks
1/4 c whole cloves
1/2 c green cardamom
1/4 c black peppercorns

Lay spices out on a sheet pan and roast in a 350F oven for ~5 min. Let cool and grind in a spice grinder. Will keep for about 2 weeks in an airtight container.

Chai Tea:
5 black tea bags
1/2 c sugar
1 tsp fresh ginger, minced
1 tsp spice mix
3 c water
1/2 c whole milk

Put all ingredients except milk in a saucepan and bring to a roaring boil. Add milk and heat to a boil again. Watch carefully - at this stage the chai can overflow very rapidly. Proper masala chai is always boiled, not steeped. Remove from heat & strain with a small sieve.
