Steak Shack ShackBurger

Sauce:
½ c Hellman's mayonnaise
1 tbsp Dijon mustard
1 tsp Heinz ketchup
¼ tsp kosher dill pickle brine

In a small bowl, stir all of the sauce ingredients until smooth, then set aside.

Burger:
4 hamburger potato buns
4 tbsp unsalted butter, melted
ShackSauce
4 pieces green-leaf lettuce
Eight ¼" slices plum tomatoes
1 lb cold ground beef, formed into 4x1" thick pucks
Kosher salt and freshly ground pepper, to taste
4 slices American cheese

Heat a large cast-iron skillet over medium-low heat. Meanwhile, open the hamburger buns and brush both sides liberally with the melted butter. Working in 2 batches, place the buns onto the heated skillet, buttered-sides down, and cook until golden brown, 2-3 min. Transfer to a plate and spoon 1 tbsp of sauce on each top bun, along with a piece of lettuce and 2 slices of tomato. Increase the heat to medium and let the pan heat up for 2-3 min On a plate, season both sides of each puck of ground beef with salt and pepper. Place the pucks into the cast-iron skillet, leaving plenty of room between them. Using a large, sturdy metal spatula, firmly smash each puck into a ⅓" thick round patty. Cook the burgers without touching them until the edges are brown and crisp, 2½ min, then flip them. Place a slice of American cheese on each burger and continue to cook until medium, 1 min. Transfer a cheeseburger to each bottom bun, then sandwich with the top bun and lettuce and tomato, and serve.
