  --@wickdconfections

3 ripe bananas, mashed (about 1½ cups / 360 g)
1/2 c sugar (100 g)
1 tsp vanilla extract
pinch salt
1/2 tsp cinnamon (optional)
1 egg, beaten
1 c fine breadcrumbs OR crushed vanilla wafers (100 g)
oil for frying
Optional for serving:
 powdered sugar
 cinnamon sugar
 honey or syrup

In a bowl combine mashed bananas, sugar, vanilla, salt, cinnamon (if using), and egg. Mix until smooth. Stir in breadcrumbs until mixture is thick enough to shape. If soft, chill 20–30 min. 

Old-Fashioned Style (Traditional) Hand-shaped croquettes — classic method.
Shape mixture into small logs or ovals (~2" long). Heat oil to 350F / 175C. Fry 2–3 min until deep golden brown. Drain on paper towels.
Texture: slightly rustic, creamy interior.

Modern Twist (Easier + Uniform) Crispy banana hush-puppy style bites.
Add 1/2 c additional breadcrumbs (50 g). Mix well and chill if needed. Use a cookie scoop to form balls ~1–1 1/2" wide. Drop gently into 350F / 175C oil. Fry 2–3 min until evenly golden. Drain on paper towels.
Texture: round, crisp all around, very uniform.

Dust with powdered sugar or cinnamon sugar. Serve warm.


Optional Flavor Variations
 pinch nutmeg or ginger
 brown sugar instead of white
 vanilla wafer crumbs for nostalgic flavor
