Pouhn-Pa (Laotian Poached Black Bass)

2 lb whole black bass, cleaned and scaled
1 tbsp canola oil
10 kaffir lime leaves
2 lemongrass stalks, smashed and cut into 4" pieces
2" piece galangal root, thinly sliced
4 c water
3 tbsp fish sauce + more to taste
1 tbsp sugar
5 small thai eggplants, stemmed
5 shallots, peeled
5 garlic cloves, peeled
3 green thai chiles, stemmed
2 jalapenos, left whole and stemmed
2 tbsp lime juice
cilantro for garnish
sticky rice for serving
sliced green cabbage for serving
steamed broccoli for serving

Preheat oven to 375F. On a clean cutting board, cut the fish into 2 skinless fillets, reserving the head and bones. Refrigerate fillets until ready to use. In a medium saucepan, heat the oil over medium high heat. Add the reserved fish head and bones with the kaffir lime leaves, lemongrass, and galangal. Sweat until aromatic, 5 min. Add the water, fish sauce, and sugar. Bring to a boil, then reduce the heat to a simmer and cook for 45 min. Meanwhile, heat a cast iron skillet over high heat. Cook the eggplant, shallots, garlic, chiles, and jalapenos, turning often, until slightly charred, 5 min. Transfer the vegetables to a large piece of foil on a baking sheet and fold the edges to form a pouch. Place the baking sheet in the oven and roast until they are tender, 35-40 min. Once the stock has finished cooking, strain and return to the pot. Bring to just below a simmer and poach the fillets until opaque, 5-6 min. Gently remove the fillets from the pot and lay out on a plate. Transfer the roasted vegetables to a large mortar and pestle. Roughly mash with lime juice, then season with fish sauce. Add the fillets and flake the flesh into large chunks. Spoon the mixture into a serving bowl and garnish with cilantro. Serve with sticky rice, cabbage, and steamed broccoli.
