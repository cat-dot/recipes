Spicy Grilled Coconut Chicken (or whatever meat)
  --Molly Baz
  
3" piece fresh ginger
5 garlic cloves
3/4 c coconut milk
1/4 c hot chili paste (i.e. sambal oelek)
1/4 c fresh lime juice
2 tbsp light brown sugar
1 tsp diamond crystal or 1 3/4 tsp kosher salt
2 tbsp vegetable oil + more for grill
2 lb skinless boneless chicken thighs (or sub skirt steak, shrimp, etc)
1/2 c cilantro leaves with tender stems for serving
lime wedges for serving

Prepare grill for medium heat. Finely grate ginger and garlic into a medium bowl. Add coconut milk, chili paste, lime juice, brown sugar, salt, and 2 tbsp oil and whisk to combine. Add chicken and toss to coat. Let sit at least 15 min or up to 4 hrs. Remove chicken from marinade, letting excess drip back into bowl, and transfer to a rimmed baking sheet. Pour marinade into a small saucepan. Bring to a boil, then reduce heat to medium low and simmer, stirring occasionally, until slightly reduced and thick enough to coat the back of a spoon, 2-3 min. Clean and generously oil grate for grill. Grill chicken, turning once and basting occasionally with marinade, until you see some good grill marks and chicken is cooked through, 8-10 min. Transfer chicken to a platter, brush with remaining marinade. Top with cilantro and serve with lime wedges.


Notes: Can cook in cast iron skillet on stovetop for ~25 min.
