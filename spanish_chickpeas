Spanish Spiced Roasted Chickpeas
  --Cook's Illustrated

2x15 oz cans chickpeas
3 tbsp evoo
1 tbsp smoked paprika
1/2 tsp ground coriander
3/8 tsp kosher salt
1/4 tsp ground cumin
1/8 tsp cayenne pepper

Adjust oven rack to middle position and heat oven to 350 F. Place chickpeas in colander and let drain for 10 min. Line large plae with double layer of paper towels. Spread chickpeas over plate in even layer. Microwave until exteriors of chickpeas are dry and many have split slightly at seams, 8-12 min. Transfer chickpeas to 13x9" metal baking pan. Add oil and stir until evenly coated. Using spatula, spread chickpeas into single layer. Transfer to oven and roast for 30 min. While chickpeas are roasting, combine paprika, coriander, salt, cumin, and cayenne in small bowl. Stir chickpeas and crowd toward center of pan, avoiding edges of pan as much as possible. Continue to roast until chicpeas appear dry, slightly shriveled, and deep golden brown, 20-40 min longer. To test doneness, remove a few paler chickpeas and let cool briefly before tasting; if interiors are soft, return to oven for 5 min before testing again. Transfer chickpeas to large bowl. Toss with spice mixture to coat. Season with salt to taste. Let cool completely before serving, ~30 min. Chickpeas can be stored in airtight container for up to 1 week.


Notes: There is no need to rinse chickpeas. Don't use glass or ceramic dish, it results in unevenly cooked chickpeas.
