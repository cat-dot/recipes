Esquites (Corn Salad)
  --Cook's Illustrated

3 tbsp lime juice + extra for seasoning (2 limes)
3 tbsp sour cream
1 tbsp mayonnaise
1–2 serrano chiles, stemmed and cut into 1/8" thick rings
Salt
2 tbsp + 1 tsp vegetable oil
6 ears corn, kernels cut from cobs (6 cups)
2 garlic cloves, minced
1/2 tsp chili powder
4 oz cotija cheese, crumbled (1 c)
3/4 c coarsely chopped fresh cilantro leaves
3 scallions, sliced thin

Combine lime juice, sour cream, mayonnaise, serrano(s), and 1/4 tsp salt in large bowl. Set aside. Heat 1 tbsp oil in 12" nonstick skillet over high heat until shimmering. Add half of corn and spread into even layer. Sprinkle with 1/4 tsp salt. Cover and cook, without stirring, until corn touching skillet is charred, about 3 minutes. Remove skillet from heat and let stand, covered, for 15 s, until any popping subsides. Transfer corn to bowl with sour cream mixture. Repeat with 1 tbsp oil, 1/4 tsp salt, and remaining corn. Return now-empty skillet to medium heat and add remaining 1 tsp oil, garlic, and chili powder. Cook, stirring constantly, until fragrant, ~30 s. Transfer garlic mixture to bowl with corn mixture and toss to combine. Let cool for at least 15 min. Add cotija, cilantro, and scallions and toss to combine. Season salad with salt and up to 1 tbsp extra lime juice to taste. Serve.


Notes: Can sub plain greek yogurt for the sour cream. can substitute a jalapeño chile that has been halved lengthwise and sliced into 1/8" thick half-moons. Adjust the amount of chiles to suit your taste. If cotija cheese is unavailable, substitute feta cheese.
