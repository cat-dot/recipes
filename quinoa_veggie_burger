Quinoa Veggie Burger

Mayo:
1/2 c mayo
1/4 c basil leaves
1/4 c parsley leaves
2 tbsp chopped chives
1 tbsp lemon juice
kosher salt and freshly ground pepper to taste

In a blender, combine all the ingredients. Blend until smooth then transfer to a bowl.

Burger:
2 c water
1 c quinoa
1/4 c olive oil, divided
1 c shiitake mushrooms, minced
1 c broccoli florets, minced
1/2 c fresh corn kernels
2 carrots, coarsely grated
1 c matzo meal
2 tsp salt
1/2 tsp freshly ground black pepper
2 eggs

In a 2 quart saucepan, bring the water and quinoa to a boil. Reduce the heat to a simmer and cook, covered, until the quinoa is tender and all the water is absorbed, 15-18 min. Transfer to a large bowl and let cool. Meanwhile, in a large skillet, heat 2 tbsp of oil over medium high heat. Add the mushrooms, broccoli, corn, carrots, and onion, and cook, stirring often, until the veggies are tender and lightly caramelized, 8-10 min. Transfer to the bowl with the quinoa and let cool. Once the ingredients are cooled, mix in the remaining ingredients until incorporated. Form into 6 1" thick patties.
In a large nonstick skillet, heat the remaining 2 tbsp of oil over medium high heat. Working in 2 batches, cook the patties until golden brown and crisp, 3 min per side.
