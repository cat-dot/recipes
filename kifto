Beef Kitfo with Injera Crisps

Injera Crisps:
2-4 pieces injera, roughly torn into 4" pieces

Preheat the oven to 325F and line a sheet tray with parchment paper. Place the injera in a single layer on the baking sheet and bake until crisp, 15-17 min.

Spiced Butter:
1/2 c unsalted butter
4 garlic cloves, halved
3" piece ginger, peeled and sliced
1 jalapeno halved
1 tbsp ground berbere

In a large saute pan, combine all ingredients and place over low heat, slowly melting and infusing the butter for 15 min. Remove from heat and set aside

Kitfo:
1/4 c unsalted butter
1 lemon zested (no pith)
2 shallots finely diced
1 small gala apple, diced
2 tbsp fresh lemon juice (1 lemon)
1 tbsp dijon mustard
1 tbsp berbere
1 lb strip loin, trimmed and diced into 1/4" pieces (2 c)
1 1/4 tsp kosher salt + more to taste
1/4 tsp fresh ground black pepper
2 cured anchovy fillets, finely diced

In a large saute pan, melt the butter with the lemon zest over medium heat. When the butter begins to foam, add the shallots and cook until translucent, 10-12 min. Add the apple, lemon juice, mustard, and berbere, stirring to combine, and cook 1 min more. Remove from the heat and keep warm. Strain the spiced butter into a large bowl and discard the solids. Reserve the saute pan as is, without wiping clean, and return to medium high heat. Place the beef in a large bowl and season with the salt and pepper. Add half of the beef mixture and cook, stirring occasionally for 30 sec. Add 2-4 tbsp of the spiced butter and cook 30 s more, then remove from heat and pour back into the remaining raw beef mixture. Fold in the apple-shallot mixture and anchovies, and stir until just combined. Adjust the seasoning to taste with salt. Don't over mix. To server, place a few pieces of injera cripsts on a place and top with the kitfo.
