Turkey Meatballs in Creamy Red Curry Sauce
  --The Modern Proper

Meatballs:
2 lb ground turkey
1/3 c fresh basil, finely chopped
4 garlic cloves, minced
2 green onions, finely chopped
2 tbsp fish sauce
1 tsp red curry paste
2 tbsp sugar
1 tbsp cornstarch
2 tsp coarse kosher salt
2 tbsp canola oil

Mix all ingredients except the canola oil together until fully incorporated. If available use a stand mixer set on medium speed with the flat beater attachment for this step. Heat oil in a large skillet or frying pan over medium heat. Using a cookie scoop or tablespoon, scoop meatballs out in 2" portions. Gently roll into a ball and place in the heated oil. Brown the meatballs on all sides in batches of 10. Do not worry about cooking all the way through. Place browned meatballs on a plate and set aside.

Sauce:
3/4 c onions, finely diced
4 garlic cloves, minced
1/4 c red curry paste
2x14oz cans coconut cream
3 tbsp lime juice
1 tbsp fish sauce
1 tbsp sugar
1 tsp salt (optional)
1/2 c fresh basil, thinly sliced (optional)
1/2 c cilantro leaves, (optional)
chili flakes, (optional)

Drain off all but 1 tbsp oil from the pan. Add the onions and sauté until soft, ~5 min. Add garlic and sauté 2 min longer. Add the curry paste and break it up as much as possible. Add the coconut cream and stir or whisk until paste and cream are fully incorporated and sauce is smooth. When sauce is smooth, add the lime juice, fish sauce, sugar and salt if using. Bring to a boil and add all the meatballs back into the curry sauce. Turn heat to a simmer, cover the pan with a lid. Simmer meatballs for 20 min until the sauce has thickened and the meatballs are cooked through the center. Add fresh basil and stir to combine. Serve over your choice of rice or roasted veggies, with cilantro and crushed red pepper flakes for additional heat.
