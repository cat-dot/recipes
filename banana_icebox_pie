Banana Icebox Pie
  -Martha Stewart

Crust:
6 oz vanilla wafers
4 tbsp unsalted butter, melted
1/4 tsp salt

Preheat oven to 350F. In a food processor, pulse cookies until finely ground (should make ~1 1/2 c). Add butter and a scant 1/4 tsp salt and pulse until combined. Firmly press crumb mixture into bottom and up sides of 9" pie tin. Bake until crust is dry and set, ~12 min. Let cool completely on a wire rack before filling.

Filling:
5 large ripe bananas, divided
1/2 c sweetened condensed milk
1/2 tsp vanilla
salt
1 c heavy cream
3 tbsp coarse sugar for serving

In a large bowl, mash 2 bananas until smooth. Stir in condensed milk, vanilla, and a pinch of salt. In a large bowl, using an electric mixer, beat cream on high until stiff peaks form, 3 min. With a rubber spatula, gently fold whipped cream into banana mixture. Transfer to crust, cover with plastic, and freeze until firm, at least 12 hrs. Cut remaining 2 bananas lengthwise into 1/4" thick slices. Layer banana slices on top of pit. Just before serving, sprinkle sugar evenly over bananas. Use a kitchen torch to brulee sugar. Return pie to freezer for a few minutes if it becomes too soft.
