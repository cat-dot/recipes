Classic Bread Stuffing
  --Cook's Illustrated

12 tbsp unsalted butter + extra for baking dish
4 medium celery ribs, chopped fine
2 medium onions, minced
1/2 c minced fresh parsley leaves
3 tbsp minced fresh sage leaves (or 2 tsp dried)
3 tbsp minced fresh thyme leaves (or 2 tsp dried)
1 tbsp minced fresh marjoram leaves (or 1 tsp dried)
3 lbs high quality sandwich bread slices (white) cut into 1/2" cubes and dried
5 c chicken stock or low sodium canned chicken broth
4 large eggs, beaten lightly
2 tsp salt
2 tsp fresh ground black pepper

Adjust oven rack to center position and heat to 400F. Heat butter in 12" skillet over medium high heat. Add the celery and onion and saute, stirring occationally, until softened, ~10 min. Stir in parsley, sage, thyme, and marjoram and cook until fragrant, ~1 min. Transfer to very large mixing bowl. Add the dried bread, stock, eggs, salt, and pepper to the vegetables and toss gently to distribute dry and wet ingredients evenly. Turn mix into buttered 15x10" baking dish. Cover with foil and bake for 25 min. Remove the foil and continue to bake until golden, ~30 min longer. Cool for 10 min before serving.

To make ahead: The stuffing can be assembled in the baking dish, then wrapped tightly in plastic wrap and refrigerated for up to 24 hrs before baking. To bake, let the stuffing stand at room temp for 30 min. Remove the wrap and proceed to bake as directed above.

Drying the bread: If you have enough lead time, can simply leave the bread out for a few days to become stale. Otherwise, spread out on baking sheets and dry in 300F oven for 30-60 min. Let the bread cool before using in stuffing. Can substitute 3x14 oz bags of plain dried bread cubes for the homemade, but will need to increase the broth to 7 c.
