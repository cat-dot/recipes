Instant Pot Cauliflower Mac and Cheese
  --Erin Clarke

1 medium/large head cauliflower
16 oz whole wheat pasta
1 tbsp unsalted butter
1 tsp kosher salt
2 oz reduced fat cream cheese
2 c freshly grated melty, flavorful cheese (cheddar, gruyere, provolone, fontina, gouda, or a mix) 
8-12 2% evaporated milk
1/2 tsp garlic powder
1/4 tsp black pepper

Cut the cauliflower into large florets, then shred with the large side of a box grater. Can also place into food processor and process until it looks like rice. Going for 4 c riced cauliflower. Place the pasta, cauliflower, 3 1/2 c water, butter, and salt in a 6 qt or larger instant pot or pressure cooker. Stir well. Set to cook on high pressure (manual) for 4 min. As soon as the timer goes off, release the steam using the valve on top. Dot the cream cheese in small pieces over the top, then gently stir in the shredded chease, 8 oz evaporated milk, garlic powder, and black pepper. If it seems too thick, add more evaporated milk or water until desired consistency is reached. Taste and add salt and pepper as needed. Serve hot.

Notes: the smaller the cauliflower rice 'grain', the easier it will combine with the cheese.
