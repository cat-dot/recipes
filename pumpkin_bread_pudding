Pumpkin Bread Pudding

4 eggs
1 c heavy cream
1 c milk
3/4 c granulated sugar
1/4 tsp kosher salt
1 tsp vanilla
6 croissants, day old and cut into 1" squares
4 oz pumpkin puree

Preheat oven to 350F. In a large bowl, beat eggs. Add the liquids, sugar, salt, vanilla, and salt. Dip the croissant squares into the mixture and place in a 9"x9" baking dish, making sure not to press or pack in the pieces. Pour remaining liquid over top. Wrap the entire dish in plastic wrap, then cover entirely with foil. Bake for ~45 min. Check the pudding after 30 min to make sure it's cooking evenly and rotate. When the pudding is ready, it will puff and a knife inserted will come out clean.

1/8 c granulated sugar
