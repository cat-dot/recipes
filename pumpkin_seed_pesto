Pumpkin Seed Pesto Rigatoni
  --Ashley Eddie

Pesto:
1  c pumpkin seeds, toasted and still warm
1½ c soffritto
2 tbsp pumpkin seed oil
1 anchovy fillet

Add the pumpkin seeds to the bowl of a food processor and pulse until finely ground. Add the remaining ingredients and process until combined.

Rigatoni:
¼ c evoo
4 cloves garlic, sliced
4 anchovy fillets
1 c fresh parsley, chopped
½ c pesto
1 lb gluten-free rigatoni (or sub your pasta of choice)
Juice of 1 lemon, as needed
Salt
½ c grated ricotta salata

Bring a pot of water to a boil and season with salt. Add the pasta and cook until al dente, and make sure to reserve the pasta water. Meanwhile, heat a separate pot over medium heat and add the olive oil, sliced garlic and anchovy fillets. Smash the anchovy into the oil and simmer, 3-5 min. Add in the parsley and pumpkin seed pesto and stir to combine. Add the pasta into the pot with the pesto, adding some pasta water to achieve the desired consistency, until incorporated and warm. Season with lemon juice and salt to taste, then plate and serve with ricotta salata.

Notes:
Soffritto is a mixture of slowly cooked carrots, onions and celery. The vegetables are roughly chopped into very small pieces and cooked in olive oil over low heat for anywhere between 30 minutes to an hour, or more. To impart the richest taste, make sure the vegetables are finely chopped and that they caramelize slightly.
