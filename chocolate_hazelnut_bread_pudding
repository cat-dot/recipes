  --America's Test Kitchen

14 oz challah, cut into 1/2" pieces
1/2 c (3 oz) semisweet chocolate chips
2 c heavy cream
2 c whole milk
9 large egg yolks
1 c nutella
3/4 c (5 1/4 oz) + 1 tbsp sugar
4 tsp vanilla
3/4 tsp salt
2 tbsp packed brown sugar

Adjust oven racks to upper middle and lower middle positions and heat oven to 300F. Spread challah evenly in 2 rimmed baking sheets and bake, stirring occasionally, until golden and crisp, ~25 min. Transfer to 12" cast iron skillet and let cool slightly. Increase oven temp to 325F. Stir chocolate chips into cooled bread. Whisk cream, milk, yolks, nutella, 3/4 c sugar, vanilla, and salt together until well combined, then pour mixture evenly over bread. Gently press on top of gread to help it soak up cream mixture. Combine brown sugar and remaining 1 tbsp sugar in bowl, then sprinkle over top. Transfer skillet to oven and bake until pudding is just set and surface is slightly crisp, 45-55 min, rotating skillet halfway through. Transfer skillet to wire rack and let cool for 30 min. Serve.
