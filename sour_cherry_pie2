Sour Cherry Lattice Pie

Filling:
4 c frozen sour cherries
2/3 c died sour cherries
7 tbsp kirsch cherry brandy
1/4 c granulated sugar
3 tbsp oj
2 tbsp unsalted butter
1 tbsp lemon zest
1/2 tsp cinnamon
1 tbsp cornstarch
1 tbsp Cointreau

In a medium saucepan, combine the cherries, kirsch, sugar, oj, butter, lemon zest, and cinnamon. Bring to a simmer, then shut off the heat and allow the mixture to steep for 1 hr. In a small bowl, mix the cornstarch with 2 tbsp of liquid from the cherry mixture until smooth, then return to the pot. Bring the mixture to a boil and cook until thickened, 2 min. Remove from the heat and stir in the Cointreau. Let cool completely.

Dough:
1 3/4 c ap flour
1 1/2 c cake flour
1 tsp salt
2 sticks + 2 tbsp unsalted butter, cubed and chilled
13 c cold water
1tsp lemon juice
1 egg, beaten, for brushing
granulated sugar, for garnish

In a medium bowl, whisk together the flours and salt. Using your fingers, work in the cold butter until pea sized clumps form. Stir in the water and lemon juice until a dough comes together. Wrap in plastic and refrigerate for 1 hr. Divide the dough in half and, on a lightly floured surface, roll each half into a 12" circle, 1/6" thick.

Preheat oven to 375F. Line the inside of a 9" pie dish with one of the dough circles, allowing a slight overhang. Fill the pie with the cooled filling and brush the edges with some of the beaten egg. Cut the other circle of dough into 8 1" strips. Layre 4 strips horizontally, then pull alternating strips back and lay the other strips perpendicularly. Trim off extra dough, then roll up the edge to make a rim around the dish. Using your fingers, crimp the edges. Brush the dough with more beaten egg, then sprinkle with granulated sugar. Bake until the crust is golden brown and the filling is bubbling, 45 min. Remove from the oven and allow to cool for 15 min.
