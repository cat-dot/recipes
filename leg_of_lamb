Roast Leg of Lamb
 - Vefa Alexiadou
 
6½ lb leg of lamb
4 garlic cloves, thinly sliced
Pinch dried oregano
Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper, to taste
2 tbsp lemon juice
2 tbsp olive oil, divided

Preheat the oven to 350°. Using a sharp knife, score the fat cap on the lamb in a crosshatch pattern. In a small bowl, toss the garlic and oregano with some salt and pepper. Rub the mixture into the scores of the lamb, seasoning with more salt and pepper as needed. Rub the lemon juice over the lamb, then brush it with 1 tbsp of the olive oil. Wrap the leg with parchment paper then secure with butcher's twine. Brush the paper with the remaining tablespoon of oil, then place the whole leg in a roasting pan. Roast until golden brown and the internal temperature reaches 140°, 2 hr. Let rest for 5 min, then discard the paper and string, and carve, serving the slices with the pan juices.
