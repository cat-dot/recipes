2 tbsp water
2 tbsp corn syrup
2 tbsp maesil cheong (plum extract syrup)
1 1/2 tbsp soy sauce
1 1/2 tbsp fish sauce
1 tbsp toasted sesame oil
1 1/2 tsp minced garlic
1 1/2 tsp gochugaru
1/2 Fresno chile, ribs and seeds removed, chopped fine
1/2 jalapeño chile, ribs and seeds removed, chopped fine
2 tbsp finely chopped yellow onion
1 green onion, chopped fine, divided
1 (14-16 oz/397-454 g) block firm tofu
1/8 tsp fine salt, divided
1 tbsp neutral cooking oil
pinch black pepper

Whisk water, corn syrup, maesil cheong, soy sauce, fish sauce, sesame oil, garlic, and gochugaru together in bowl. Stir in Fresno chile, jalapeño, yellow onion, and half of green onion. Set sauce aside. 
Rinse tofu and pat dry with paper towels. Halve tofu block lengthwise, then cut crosswise into 1/2" slices. Arrange tofu in single layer on paper towel–lined plate. Pat tops dry with additional paper towels, then sprinkle with pinch of salt. Heat neutral oil in 12" nonstick skillet over medium-high heat until shimmering. Arrange tofu salted side down in skillet. Sprinkle with remaining pinch of salt and cook until light golden brown, 3-5 min per side. Add sauce and cook, constantly spooning sauce over tofu, until sauce has thickened and begins to coat tofu, ~2 min. Remove skillet from heat and sprinkle with remaining chopped green onion and pepper. Serve. (Refrigerate for up to 1 week.)
