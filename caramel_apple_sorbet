Caramel Apple Sorbet

1 1/4 c (185g) coconut palm sugar
1 1/4 lbs (565g) sweet crisp apples (ex. fuji) cored and cut into large bite-sized chunks
2 tbsp lemon juice (ore more to taste)
water
salt to taste

In a medium saucepan over medium high heat, combine the sugar with 1 1/4 c (295mL) water and bring to a boil, stirring to dissolve the sugar. Remove from the heat and set aside to cool to room temp. Meanwhile, in another medium saucepan over medium high heat, combine the appls and 1/4 c (60mL) water and bring to a boil. Lower the heat to a simmer, cover partially, and cook, stirring occasionally, until the apples are very tender, 15-20 min. Transfer the apples, along with any accumulated juices, to a food processor and puree, scraiping down the bowl as necessary. Strain the puree through a medium mesh sieve into a mixing bowl, pressing the solids with the back of a spoon. Stir in the sugar mixture and lemon juice. Add more lemon and salt to taste. Thoroughly chill the base in the refrigerator, then freeze in your ice-cream maker per manufacturer's directions.
