Pear, Pistachio, and Rose Cake
  --Nigella Lawson

Cake:
Vegetable oil, for greasing
1 c sugar
¾ c shelled pistachios
1 lb (approximately 3) thin-skinned pears, such as Bartlett, cored and cut into chunks, skin on
2 c fine almond flour
1½ tsp baking powder
6 large eggs, room temperature
1½ tsp rosewater

Preheat the oven to 350F. Grease the sides of a 9" springform cake pan and line the base with parchment paper. Put the sugar and ¾ c of pistachios into a food processor and blitz until the pistachios are finely ground, with a few nubbly bits, too. Add the remaining cake ingredients and blitz until everything is smoothly combined and the pears have been puréed into the batter. Remove the blade, scrape down the mixture, and use the spatula to help ease every bit of batter into the prepared pan. Bake for 40-50 min, though take a look at 35 min and if the cake looks like it's browning too fast, loosely cover with aluminum foil. When the cake's ready, it will be brown on top, beginning to come away at the edges, and a cake tester will come out with just a few damp crumbs sticking to it. Sit the cake on a wire rack and leave to cool completely in the pan; like all flourless cakes, it will sink a little. When the cake is completely cold, unclip, remove the base, and transfer to a cake stand or plate.

Topping:
2 tsp apricot preserves
½ tsp lemon juice
½ tsp rosewater

Mix the preserves, lemon juice, and rosewater together in a cup, then brush this glaze over the surface of the cake, removing any small blobs of apricot if there are any. Scatter with finely chopped pistachios and strew with rose petals, then sprinkle a few more pistachio crumbs on the top.
