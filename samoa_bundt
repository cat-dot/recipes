Samoa Inspired Bundt Cake

Cake
2 c flour
1 tsp baking powder
1 tsp baking soda
1 tsp freshly grated nutmeg
1 tsp ground cinnamon
½ tsp kosher salt
1 c sugar
6 tbsp unsalted butter, softened + more for greasing
1 tsp vanilla extract
3 eggs
1 c buttermilk
½ c dark chocolate chips
½ c unsweetened shredded coconut, lightly toasted

Preheat the oven to 350°. In a medium bowl, whisk together the flour, baking powder, baking soda, nutmeg, cinnamon and salt, then set aside. In a stand mixer fitted with the whisk attachment, beat the sugar, butter and vanilla until fluffy. Add the eggs, one at a time, beating well until incorporated. With the motor running, slowly add the dry ingredients in 2 batches, alternating with the buttermilk, until a smooth batter forms. Gently fold in the chocolate chips and toasted coconut, then pour into a greased 9" bundt pan. Bake until a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean, 30-35 min. Let cool 10 min, then invert the cake onto a wire rack and let cool completely.

Caramel Sauce
8 tbsp unsalted butter
½ c light brown sugar
½ vanilla bean, split lengthwise and scraped
¼ c heavy cream
½ tbsp fresh lemon juice
½ tsp kosher salt

In a 4-quart saucepan, melt the butter over medium heat. Add the sugar, vanilla bean and seeds, and cook until the sugar is dissolved and the mixture is bubbling, 4-5 min. Remove from the heat and stir in the cream, lemon juice and salt. Let cool completely.

Assembly
¼ c dark chocolate chips, melted
1 tbsp coconut oil
¼ c unsweetened shredded coconut, lightly toasted

Transfer the cake to a serving platter and drizzle with the caramel sauce. In a small bowl, mix together the melted chocolate and coconut oil. Drizzle the chocolate in parallel lines over the cake, then sprinkle with toasted coconut. Slice and serve.
