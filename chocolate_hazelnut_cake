Chocolate and Hazelnut Cake

4 eggs, separated
100g (3.5oz) caster (superfine) sugar
1 tbsp water
100g (3.5oz) chocolate hazelnut spread
80g (3oz) butter
90g (3.25oz) ap flour
pinch of salt
450 ml (15floz) milk at room temp
20cm (8") square cake tin, silicone or greased with butter and lined with parchment paper.

Preheat oven to 300F. Whisk the egg yolks with the sugar and water until the mixture whitens. Stir in the spread. Melt the butter and pour it into the mixture. Then fold in the flour and salt. Beat for a few minutes more. Pour in the milk little by little, beating constantly. Beat the egg whites until stiff and, using a whisk, gently incorporate them into the batter. Pour the batter into the prepared tin, smooth the surface with the blade of a knife and bake for 50 min. When the cake comes out it will wobble slightly. Leave it set in the fridge for min 2 hrs, overnight better. Decorate with a few crushed hazelnuts.
