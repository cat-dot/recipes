1 lb peeled yukon potatoes, all approximately the same size
1 tsp salt + more for boiling water
1 tsp coriander powder
1 tsp cumin powder
1/4 tsp cayenne powder
1/2 c breadcrumbs
4 tbsp oil

Boil peeled potatoes in salted water on high heat for 25-40 min (depending on size of potato) until soft. Drain the potatoes and place them in a bowl, mashing and kneading them with your hands. Add salt, coriander, cumin, and cayenne to the potatoes. Knead until seasoned evenly. Form patties ~ 2" in diameter and 1/4" thick. Pour the bread crumbs onto a plate, distributing evenyly. Dredge the patties in the bread brumbs until evenly coated. Add 2 tbsp oil to a skillt on medium heat. Once the oil is hot, fry patties in batches, being careful not to crowd the pan. Cook until they are golden on one side, then carefully flip the patties to brown on the other side. Add more oil as needed. Drain on paper towels. Serve with hot salsa or ketchup.
