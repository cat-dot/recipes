Garlic Soup
  --Julie Laing

2 heads garlic
1 medium onion
2 tbsp evoo
1 tbsp fresh or 1 tsp dried thyme
1/2 tsp salt
freshly ground black pepper to taste
6 c vegetable stock
2 eggs
grated cheese to taste

Heat oven to 400F. Wrap each whole head of garlic in foil. Bake for 15-25 min, until the papery skin begins to brown and the cloves are slightly soft. Let sit until cool enough to handle, then separate the cloves and unwrap or squeeze them from their skin. Set aside. Thinly slice onion. In a large stockpot, heat evoo over medium heat. Add the onion and cook for 10 min, until onion begins to brown. Stir in the garlic, thyme, salt, and pepper, and then pour in the stock. Raise the heat to bring the soup to a boil, then lower it to simmer for 15 min. Taste and adjust the seasoning as needed. Using an immersion or upright blender, blend the soup to your desired texture. In a small bowl, use a wire whisk to beat the eggs to a uniform color. Whisk 3-4 spoonfuls of hot soup into the eggs until the mixture is warm. Remove the soup from the heat, and add the eggs in a thin stream, stirring continually with the whisk as you pour. Sprinkle cheese to taste and serve immediately.
