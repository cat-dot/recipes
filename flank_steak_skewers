Flank Steak 
  --Grandma Tosh
  
1 1/2 lbs flank steak
1 c beef bouillon
1 tsp salt
1 tsp seasoned salt
1/3 c onion, chopped fine
1/8 tsp garlic powder
1/2 c shoyu
2 tbsp fresh lemon juice
2 tbsp honey

Cut steak into diagonal strips ~1" wide. Combine remaining ingredients, add steak & marinate 2-4hrs. Remove meat from marinade& thread onto skewers. Broil 4-5 min, turning once.


Notes: I think my mom embelished this given this recipe has more direction than usual. Definitely soak the skewers in water before using. Typically my grandfather would cook the meat over a hibachi. I will say last time I made it, was very salty so would probably choose either salt or seasoned salt, but not both,.
