One-pan Chicken with Kale and Butternut Squash
  --America's Test Kitchen
  
1/2 c cold-pressed evoo
2 tbsp minced fresh sage
2 tsp honey
Salt and pepper
3/4 c organic plain low-fat yogurt
1 tbsp water
7 garlic cloves, peeled (6 whole, 1 minced)
1 tsp grated orange zest
8 oz kale, stemmed and cut into 2" pieces
2 lb butternut squash, peeled, seeded, and cut into 1" pieces (6 c)
8 shallots, peeled and halved
1/2 c dried cranberries
2 tsp paprika
4x8-10 oz organic bone-in split chicken breasts, trimmed of all visible fat and halved crosswise

Adjust oven rack to upper-middle position and heat oven to 475F. Whisk oil, sage, honey, 3/4 tsp salt, and Â½ teaspoon pepper together in large bowl until well combined. In separate bowl whisk together yogurt, water, minced garlic, orange zest, and 1 tbsp oil mixture, then season with salt and pepper to taste; set aside. Vigorously squeeze and massage kale with hands in large bowl until leaves are uniformly darkened and slightly wilted, ~1 min. Add squash, shallots, cranberries, whole garlic cloves, and 1/4 c oil mixture and toss to combine. Whisk paprika into remaining oil mixture, then add chicken to oil mixture and toss to coat. Spread vegetable mixture in single layer on rimmed baking sheet, then place chicken, skin side up, on top of vegetables. Bake until chicken registers 160 degrees, 25-35 min, rotating sheet halfway through baking. Remove skin from chicken and discard if desired. Transfer chicken to serving platter, tent with aluminum foil, and let rest for 5-10 min. Toss vegetables with any accumulated chicken juices and transfer to platter with chicken. Drizzle 1/4 c yogurt sauce over chicken and vegetables and serve, passing remaining yogurt sauce separately.



Notes: Both curly and Lacinato kale will work.
