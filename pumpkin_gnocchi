Pumpkin Gnocchi
  --Bosch

1 1/3 lbs Hokkaido pumpkins
3 1/2 oz Parmesan cheese
14 oz potatoes
1 egg
11 oz flour
1 pinch nutmeg
2 tbsp butter
1/4 c apple juice
1 c milk
salt
pepper
2 tbsp vegetable oil (for coating)\
rosemary (for decorating)
flour (for dusting)
pumpkin seed (for serving)
pumpkin seed oil (for serving)

Preheat the oven to 320F/160C. Line a baking sheet with parchment paper. Roughly chop the pumpkin into pieces and transfer it to the baking sheet. Add oil, mix to coat, and bake for ~30 min. Peel the potatoes and boil them in a large pot of salted water until soft, ~25 min. Drain them and transfer back to the pot to steam dry. Press the cooked potatoes through a potato ricer into a large bowl. Place the baked pumpkin pieces in a food processor and blend until smooth. Add the pumpkin pur√©e along with the egg to the pressed potatoes; the potatoes and pumpkin should still be warm. Add most of the flour, nutmeg, and salt and gently knead the ingredients into a dough. On a well-floured countertop, divide the dough into several pieces and shape them into strands, ~1"/2 cm thick. Cut off pieces of dough, 1"/2 cm wide and shape them into small balls. Using a toothpick, "stamp" the typical pumpkin patterns into the dough. Lastly, decorate each pumpkin with some rosemary leaves. Bring a pot of salted water to the boil. Add the gnocchi, lower the heat if needed, and gently simmer the gnocchi until they start floating to the top. Once the gnocchi float to the top, they are ready. Remove with a slotted spoon. Finely grate the Parmesan. Heat the butter in a pan over medium heat. Stir in remaining flour. Then add apple juice and milk, stirring constantly. Finish the sauce with the Parmesan, salt and pepper and stir to combine. Serve the gnocchi with the Parmesan sauce, pumpkin seeds, and pumpkin seed oil. Enjoy!
