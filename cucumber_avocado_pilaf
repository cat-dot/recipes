Cucumber Avocado Rice Pilaf

1/3 c canola oil
1/2 yellow onion, minced
3 garlic cloves, minced
2 c long grain rice
2 c + 1 tbsp water
1 tbsp salt + more to taste
1 c small diced cucumber, divided
1 avocado, peeled, pitted, and small dice
2 tbsp roughly chopped cilantro + more for garnish
thinly sliced scallions for garnish

Heat oven to 400F. In a 4 quart, ovenproof saucepan, heat the canola oil over medium high heat. Add the onion and garlic and cook until golden brown, 7 min. Add the rice and toast until fragrant, 1 min. Stir in the water and salt and bring to a simmer. Once simmering, quickly place lid on the pan and transfer to the oven. Cook until the rice is tender, 20 min. Remove from the oven and let sit for 5 min with the lid still on. Meanwhile, place 1/2 c of the cucumber in a blender or small food processor and puree until smooth. Add to the rice with the remaining ingredients and fluff with a fork to incorporate. Season with salt. Transfer to serving platter and garnish with cilantro and scallions.
