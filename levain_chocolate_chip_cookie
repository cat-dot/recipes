Levain Chocolate Chip Cookie
  --Joshua Weissman's interpretation
  
1.5 c (230g) cake flour
2 c (275g) ap flour
1.5 tsp (5g) kosher salt
2 tsp (8g) cornstarch
1/2 tsp (6g) baking soda
1 1/4 c (280g) unsalted butter, melted and cooled
1 1/4 c (285g) light brown sugar
1/2 c (115g) sugar
2 eggs
3 egg yolks
2 c (165g) toasted walnuts, chopped
1 lb (450g) chopped chocolate (60-70%)

Combine flours, salt, cornstarch, and baking soda with a whisk in a medium size bowl. Combine sugars in a stand mixer fitted with a whisk attachment. Slowly drizzle in butter and continue to whisk until it looks nice and creamy. Add eggs one at a time, mixing to combine after each addition; do the same for the yolks. Once mixture looks nice and homogeneous, switch to paddle attachment and mix in flour. Don't overmix. Once all flour is incorporated, fold in the walnuts and chocolate pieces. Refrigerate for at least 45 min. To make Levain sized cookies, measure out 6 oz of dough per cookie, using a scoop. Refrigerate cookies on baking sheets (4 per sheet) for another 25 min. Bake at 425F for 10-12 min, you want them to be slightly underdone in the middle.
