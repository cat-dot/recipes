4 tbsp unsalted butter, cut into 4 pieces and chilled, divided
1 onion, chopped fine
5 garlic cloves, minced
4 tsp grated fresh ginger
1 serrano chile, stemmed, seeded, and minced
1 tbsp garam masala
1 tsp ground coriander
1/2 tsp ground cumin
½ teaspoon pepper
1 1/2 c water
1/2 c tomato paste
1 tbsp sugar
2 tsp table salt, divided
1 cup heavy cream
2 lb boneless, skinless chicken thighs, trimmed
1/2 c plain Greek yogurt
3 tbsp chopped fresh cilantro, divided

Melt 2 tbsp butter in large saucepan over medium heat. Add onion, garlic, ginger, and serrano and cook, stirring frequently, until mixture is softened and onion begins to brown, 8-10 min. Add garam masala, coriander, cumin, and pepper and cook, stirring frequently, until fragrant, ~3 min. Add water and tomato paste and whisk until no lumps of tomato paste remain. Add sugar and 1 tsp salt and bring to boil. Off heat, stir in cream. Using immersion blender or blender, process until smooth, 30-60 s. Return sauce to simmer over medium heat and whisk in remaining 2 tbsp butter. Remove saucepan from heat and cover to keep warm. (Sauce can be refrigerated for up to 4 days; gently reheat sauce before adding hot chicken.) Adjust oven rack 6" from broiler element and heat broiler. Combine chicken, yogurt, and remaining 1 tsp salt in bowl and toss well to coat. Using tongs, transfer chicken to wire rack set in aluminum foil—lined rimmed baking sheet. Broil until chicken is evenly charred on both sides and registers 175F, 16-20 min, flipping chicken halfway through broiling. Let chicken rest for 5 min. While chicken rests, warm sauce over medium-low heat. Cut chicken into 3/4" chunks and stir into sauce. Stir in 2 tbsp cilantro and season with salt to taste. Transfer to serving dish, sprinkle with remaining 1 tbsp cilantro, and serve.



Notes: If you prefer a spicier dish, reserve, mince, and add the ribs and seeds from the chile.
