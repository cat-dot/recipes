Vegetarian Lentil and Sweet Potato Empanada

1 c vegetable broth
1/4 c black beluga lentils
3 tbsp unsalted butter
1/2 onion, chopped (~1c)
1 jalapeno, seeded and chopped
1 smallish sweet potato, peeled and cut into 1/4" dice (~1c)
1 chipotle in adobo sauce + 1 tsp adobo sauce
1/4 c white wine
salt and black pepper to taste
1 package (2 shets) puff pastry, thawed according to package instructions

Preheat oven to 375F. Line 2 baking sheets with parchment paper and set aside. Bring vegetable broth to a simmer in a small saucepan set over medium heat. Stir in lentils, then reduce heat to medium low. Cover and cook for 18-20 min, stirring occasionally, until lentils are just al-dente. Remove from heat. Meanwhile, melt butter in a large skillet over medium heat. Add onion and jalapeno and cook until softened, about 4 min. Add sweet potato and chipotle and stir, cooking for ~ 4 min.  Season with salt and pepper. Add wine and stir until mostly absorbed, ~1 min, then add lentils and their cooking liquid. Stir mixture until liquid is mostly evaporated and sweet potatoes are just tender, ~3-4 min more. Remove from heat and let cool slightly. On a lightly floured surface, roll out one puff pastry sheet to a 12x12" square. Cut into 9 equal squares. Place about 1 tbsp of filling in the center of each square (do not overfill). Bring the opposite corners together to form a triangle encasing the filling, pressing the edges to seal. Place on prepared baking sheets, then crimp edges with a fork to seal further. Repeat with second pastry. Bake for about 20 min or until golden brown.


Sauce:
1/4 c sour cream
1/4 c goat cheese
1 tbsp lime juice (1/2 lime)
1/2 c packed cilantro leaves
2 tbsp milk
salt and black pepper to taste

Combine sour cream, goat cheese, lime juice, and cilantro in a blender or food processor. Pulse until smooth. Add milk as needed to achieve desired consistency (thicker for dipping, thinner for drizzling). Season with a pinch of salt and pepper.
