Crab Cakes

2 tbsp softened unsalted butter
1/4 c mayonnaise
1 lemongrass stalk, trimmed and minced
1 large shallot, minced
zest of 1 lemon
1 lb cooked fresh jumbo lump crab meat
1/2 c panko + more for breading
kosher salt to taste
canola oil for frying

In a stand mixer fitted with the paddle attachment, whip the butter, mayonnaise, lemongrass, shallots, and lemon zest until incorporated. Place the crab in a mixing bowl and gently fold in the butter mixture and 1/4 c of the panko. Season with salt. Divid the mixture into 6 equal portions, and using your hands, gently form into patties. Place the cakes in the fridge for 15 m to chill and firm up slightly. Meanwhile, in food processor, pulse the remaining 1/4 c panko until finely ground. Place the panko in a shallow baking dish. Coat the crab cakes on all sides with the panko. In a large skillet over medium heat, add enough oil to coat the bottom of the pan. Brown both sides of the cakes, flipping once, until gbd, 6-8 m.
