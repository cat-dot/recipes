Veggieful Enchiladas
  --Waffles & Mochi, Pass the Love

1 can black beans (15 oz)
Frozen corn (15 oz)
2 each chipotle peppers in adobo sauce
3 tbsp + 1/4 c parmesan cheese, divided
2 tbsp flour
2 cloves garlic, minced
2 tsp adobo sauce
1 can tomato sauce (15.5 oz)
1/4 tsp salt
8 flour tortillas (6")

With the rack in the upper third, preheat your oven to 450. Drain and rinse canned beans and corn; chop chipotle peppers. In a medium bowl, combine black beans, corn and 3 tbsp Parmesan cheese. In another medium bowl, whisk to combine flour, chipotle peppers, adobo sauce, garlic and 1 c of water. Stir in tomato sauce and season with salt. On the bottom of an ovenproof skillet or baking dish, spread just enough enchilada sauce so that the bottom is covered (to prevent enchiladas from sticking). Arrange tortillas on a work surface. Divide filling evenly among the tortillas. Roll up each tortilla and place in a single layer in the skillet, seam side down. Adjust the rolls as you go so that enchiladas sit snugly in the skillet. Pour remaining sauce over enchiladas, and then sprinkle with remaining 1/4 c Parmesan cheese. Bake enchiladas on the upper oven rack until the cheese is melted and sauce is bubbling, ~15 min.
