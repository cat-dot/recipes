Galinhada (Brazilian Chicken Stew)

Stew:
3 1/2-4lb chicken, broken down into 10 pieces
2 c cilantro leaves, roughly chopped
1 c parsley leaves, roughly chopped
1 c basil leaves, roughly chopped
1/2 c spearmint leaves
6 tbsp ground annatto seeds
5 garlic cloves, roughly chopped
4 plum tomatoes, roughly chopped
2 medium yellow onions, roughly chopped
1 jalapeno, stemmed and roughly chopped
1 bay leaf
kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper to taste
8 c chicken stock
8 oz okra, cut into 1" pieces
3/4 c white vinegar
1/3 c tapioca flour

In a large bowl, combine all the ingredients except: stock, okra, vinegar, and flour. Toss the chicken to coat. Let marinate in the refrigerator overnight. The next day, combine the chicken in a 6 quart dutch oven with the stock. Bring to a simmer and cook, stirring occasionally until the chicken is tender and the liquid has reduced slightly, 1hr. Meanwhile, place the okra in a small bowl and cover with vinegar. Let soak for 20 min, then drain, discarding the vinegar. Add to the stew to simmer for the last 5 min.

Rice:
2 tbsp vegetable oil
1 small yellow onion, finely chopped
2 c long-grain white rice
4 c water

In a medium saucepan, heat the vegetable oil over medium heat. Add the onion and sweat until translucent, 5 min. Add hte rice and stir to incorporate, then pour in the water and bring to a simmer. Once simmering, cover and cook until the water is absorbed and the rice is tender, 15 min. Fluff with a fork, then keep warm until ready to serve.


In a small bowl, ladle in 1 c of the stewing liquid and whisk the flour until thickened. Pour into the stew and stir to combine, then let simmer until the stew is thickened, 3-5 min.

Serve ladling the stew over the rice.
