Chocolate Guiness Cake

Cake:
1 c cocoa powder
1 c (2 sticks) unsalted butter, softened
2 1/2 c sugar
4 large eggs
2 1/2 c ap flour
1/2 tsp baking powder
1/2 tsp baking soda
1/2 tsp kosher salt
1/8 tsp ground nutmeg
1 tbsp vanilla
1/2 c half and half
1/2 c guiness, room temp

Heat the oven to 325F. Coat a 12 c bundt pan very well with cooking spray. Sprinkle in a bit of cocoa powder, turning to coat evenly, then overturning to discard any excess. In a large bowl, use an electric mixer to beat together the butter and sugar. Add the eggs, one at a time, and beat until smooth. Set aside. In a large bowl, whisk together cocoa powder, flour, baking powder, baking soda, salt, and nutmeg. In a 2 c liquid measuring cup, stir together the vanilla, half and half, and guiness. With the mixer running on low, alternate adding the liquid and dry ingredients, mixing just until everything is mixed and smooth. Transfer to the prepared bundy pan, tapping it gently on the counter to release air bubbles. Smooth the top, then bake for 1 hr 10 min or until a toothpick inserted in the center comes out clean.

Glaze:
2 c powdered sugar
3 tbsp cocoa powder
6 tbsp guiness
2 tbsp half and half or heavy cream
1/2 tsp vanilla
pinch kosher salt

In a medium bowl, whisk together all ingredients until smooth; set aside.

When cake is done, let it cool in the pan for 25 min. Set a wire rack over the pan, then invert it so the cake stands on the rack. For ease of cleaning, set the rack over a rimmed baking sheet or a sheet of parchment paper. Use a toothpick to poke deep holes all over the top of the cake. Spoon the glaze over the top of the cake and wait until it seeps into the holes. Spoon more glaze into the holes, then wait 10 min. Spoon the remaining glaze all over the top so it covers the holes and drizzles down the sides.
