Faloodeh

Macerated strwberries

1 lb strawberries, cut into wedges
1/4 c lime juice

In a medium mixing bowl, combine strawberries & lime juice and let them site at room temperature for 30 min, tossing them occasionally until macerated. Strain the mixture and reserve 1/2 c of liquid. Pour the remaining liquid back into the bowl with the strawberries and set aside.

2 ox rice vermicelli noodles
8 1/2 c water, divided
1 3/4 c granulated sugar
1 tbsp rose water

Place the vermicelli in a bowl, In a large saucepan over high heat, bring 6 c of lightly salted water to a boil and pour the water over the noodles. Soak the noodles until they are tender, about 3-4 min. Drain and rinse the noodles with cold water. Using scissors, snip the noodles into 1-2" pieces; set them aside. In a medium saucepan over medium-high heat, combine the remaining 2 1/2 c of water and sugar. Stir the mixture until the sugar dissolves, about 3-4 min. Remove the sugar from the heat and stir in the rose water. Pour the mixture into a non-reactive bowl along with the reserved 1/2 c of macerated strawberry liquid, and chill in the fridge for at least 2 hrs. Pour the chilled faloodeh base into a pre-chilled bowl of an ice cream machine & follow the manufacturer's instructions to churn until the mixture begins to turn icy around the edges, about 10-15 min. Add the rice noodles to the mixture and continue to churn until the noodles begin to freeze and the mixture begins to look like a slush, about 10-15 min. Transfer to an airtight container, and place plastic wrap directly onto the faloodeh. Chill in freezer for at least 3 hrs before serving.
To server: scoop the faloodeh into a chilled glass or bowl, then top with the macerated strawberries, pistachios, mint, rose petals, and lime juice.
