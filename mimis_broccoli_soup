Mimi's Broccoli Soup
-credit to Mimi Hui

1 bag of frozen broccoli
1 bouillon cube
hot water to cover the broccoli

Add everything to a pot and bring to a boil. Once broccoli is tender, take off heat and let cool. Once cool enough, blend. Reheat and serve.


Notes: I'm guessing you could use an immersion blender if you're imatient and don't want to wait for it to cool. I'm also guessing you can add whatever seasoning you want to mix it up.
