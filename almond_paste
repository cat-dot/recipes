Almond Paste
  --Samira @ Alphafoodie
  
3 c meal
3 tbsp powdered sugar
1/4 tsp vanilla powder (optional)
1/8 tsp salt

Add all ingredients and process in a food processor until the mixture starts to clump up into a dough. It should be a malleable mixture that is formable but not too tough. If you've added almond extract, taste the paste and adjust as needed. If you use liquid sweetener, begin by adding 1 tbsp at a time and increase by 1 tsp until you have a malleable dough. Typically the paste is rolled into a log, can use beeswax wrap, parchment, or clingfilm and store in refrigerator for up to 10 days if you use water, or several weekds using syrup or without added liquid (3-4) Can store in freezer for up to 3 months. Makes 2 c.
