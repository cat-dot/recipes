Bucatini all'Amatriciana
  --Cook's Country
  
1 lb bucatini
1/2 tsp table salt + for cooking pasta
4 oz guanciale
2 tbsp extra-virgin olive oil
1/2 small onion, sliced thin
1/2 tsp red pepper flakes
1/4 c red wine
28 oz can whole peeled tomatoes, crushed by hand
1 oz Pecorino Romano cheese, grated (1/2 c) + extra for serving

Bring 4 qt water to boil in large Dutch oven. Add pasta and 1 tbsp salt and cook, stirring often, until al dente. Reserve 1/2 c cooking water, then drain pasta and return it to pot. Meanwhile, slice guanciale into 1/2" thick strips, then cut each strip crosswise into 1/2" pieces. Add oil, onion, pepper flakes, and guanciale to large saucepan and cook over medium heat, stirring frequently, until fat is rendered and guanciale and onion just begin to brown, ~7 min. Add wine and cook until reduced by half, ~1 min. Stir in tomatoes and their juice and salt and bring to simmer. Reduce heat to medium-low and cook, stirring frequently, until slightly thickened, ~10 min. Add Pecorino, sauce, and 1/4 c reserved cooking water to pasta and toss until sauce looks glossy and evenly coats pasta, 1-2 min. Adjust consistency with remaining reserved cooking water as needed. Serve, passing extra Pecorino separately.



Notes: Can substitute pancetta for the guanciale, parmesan for pecorino
