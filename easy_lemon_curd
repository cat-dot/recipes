  --Bibby's Kitchen@36

1 c sugar
juice from 2 lemons
2 eggs
50 g cold butter, cut into cubes

Place the sugar in a heatproof bowl. Stir in the lemon juice. Add the eggs and whisk together. Microwave on high for 1 min. Whisk thoroughly. Place back in the microwave for another minute and repeat once more. Whisk again and cook for another 30 s. This means, you’ll have completed 3 1/2 min in total. Lastly, whisk in the cubed butter until incorporated and smooth. Pour into sterilised jars and seal. It’s best stored in the refrigerator. Once opened, use with 7 days.
