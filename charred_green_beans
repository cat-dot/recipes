2 tsp + 2 tbsp vegetable oil
1 tsp gochugaru (korean red pepper flakes)
1 tsp toasted sesame oil
3/4 tsp kosher salt

Remove skillet from heat; add gochugaru, sesame oil, salt, and orange zest; stir to combine. Transfer to a bowl and set aside. Wash out skillet thoroughly and dry with paper towels. Rinse green beans but do not dry. Place in a medium bowl, cover, and microwave until tender, 6-12 min, stirring every 3 min. Using tongs, transfer green beans to paper towel lined plate and let drain. Heat remaining 2 tbsp oil in now empty skillet over high heat until just smoking. Add green beans in single layer. Cook, without stirring, until green beans begin to blister and char, 4-5 min. Toss gree beans and continue to cook, stirring occasionally, until green beans are softened and charred, 4-5 min longer. Using tongs, transfer green beans to serving dish, leaving any excess oil in skillet. Sprinkle with scallions and sesame mixture and serve.


Notes: If beans are thin and tender, microwave for 6-8 min; if thicker and tougher, nuke for 10-12 min. Can cook beans in boiling water for 5 min if you don't want to use microwave.
