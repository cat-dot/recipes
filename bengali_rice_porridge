Bengali Rice Porridge with Lentils and Chicken
  --Sohla El-Waylly

3/4 c jasmine rice (5 1/3 oz; 150g)
1" fresh turmeric (1/2 oz; 15g), or 1 teaspoon dried turmeric
1" fresh ginger (1/2 oz; 15g)
2 tbsp unsalted butter or ghee (1 oz; 30g)
1/2 tsp Kashmiri red chile powder or 1/4 tsp cayenne
1/4 c red lentils (1.8 oz; 50g), sorted and rinsed
6 c chicken stock (1 1/2 qt; 1.4L), homemade or store-bought
Kosher salt, to taste
Freshly ground black pepper, to taste
1 medium russet potato (10 oz; 280g), peeled and diced into 1/2-inch pieces
2 chicken thighs (8 oz; 224g)
1/2 bunch cilantro (1 oz; 30g), finely chopped
2 Thai green chiles, finely chopped
2 tbsp (30ml) freshly squeezed lime juice from 2 limes
2 tbsp mustard oil (1 oz; 30ml)
Crispy fried shallots, for garnish

In a medium bowl, rinse rice with cold water until water runs clear. Cover rice with fresh cold water and set aside to soak. Meanwhile, peel turmeric (if using fresh) and ginger with a spoon. Thinly slice crosswise into 1/8" coins and slice each coin into 1/8" matchsticks. Drain rice and return to bowl. Gently crush with a muddler, rolling pin, or pestle, breaking rice into uneven pieces ranging from cornmeal-sized grains to larger pieces that are cracked or shattered in half. In a 4 qt saucepan over medium heat, melt butter until foamy. Add turmeric, ginger, and red chile and cook until fragrant, ~2 min. Add rice, lentils, and chicken stock. Season with kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper. Bring to a boil, then reduce to a bare simmer. Simmer porridge, uncovered, until rice and lentils are tender, ~30 min. Add potato and chicken thighs to porridge. Cook gently until potatoes are tender, chicken is cooked through, and porridge is thickened, ~30 min, stirring occasionally to prevent sticking. Meanwhile, prepare the cilantro chutney. In a small bowl, mix cilantro and green chiles with lime juice and mustard oil, then season with salt. Stir to combine. Remove chicken from porridge and transfer to a cutting board. When cool enough to handle, dice chicken into 1/2" pieces and return to porridge. Adjust seasoning to taste with kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper, and add water if porridge becomes too thick. Remove from heat and pour porridge into bowls. Garnish with cilantro chutney and crispy fried shallots to taste.
