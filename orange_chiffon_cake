  --Cook's Country

Bater:
5 large eggs, separated
1 tsp cream of tartar
1 1/4 c sugar, divided
1 1/3 c cake flour
2 tsp baking powder
1/2 tsp salt
3/4 c oj
1/2 c oil
1 tbsp vanilla
1 tbsp grated orange zest

Separate eggs when they're cold. Adjust oven rack to lower middle position and heat oven to 325F. With electric mixxer fitted with whisk attachment, whip egg whites and cream of tartar on medium high speed until soft peaks form, ~2 min. With mixer running, slowly add 2 tbsp sugar and whip until just stiff and glossy, ~1 min; set aside. Combine flour, remaining sugar, baking powder, and salt in large bowl. Whisk oj, oil, yolks, vanilla, and zest in medium bowl until smooth. Whisk wet into flour mixture until smooth. Whisk 1/3 whipped egg whites into batter, then gently fold in remaining whites, 1 scoop at a time, until well combined. Scrape mixture into 16 c ungreased tube pan. Bake until toothpick inserted into center comes out clean and cracks in cake appear dry, 55-65 min. Cool, inverted, to room temp, ~3 hrs. Unmold, run a flexible knife around the edges; use tube to pull cake out of pan; cut bottom free, then invert cake onto serving plate.

Glaze:
3 tbsp oj
2 tbsp cream cheese, softened
1/2 tsp grated orange zest
1 1/2 c confectioners' sugar

Whisk oj, cream cheese, and zest in medium bowl until smooth. Add sugar and whisk until smooth. Pour glaze over cooled cake. Let glaze set 15 min before serving.
