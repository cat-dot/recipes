Charred Tomato Oil

2 c cherry tomatoes
30 garlic cloves
1 red bell pepper
4 c olive oil
1 tbsp oregano, chopped
4 oil cured anchovies, minced
1 fresh bay leaf
pinch crushed red pepper flakes
kosher salt to taste

Preheat the broiler to high. Place the tomatoes, garlic, and pepper on a foil lined baking sheet. Roast the vegetables, turning as needed, until the skins are charred and blistered, 6-8 min. Transfer the vegetables directly to a food processor. Add the remaining ingredients and let sit in the food processor to infuse for 30 min. Pulse the mixture until a chunky puree forms, then allow to infuse for another 30 min. Pour the mixture through a cheesecloth lined strainer over a medium bowl. Let the mixture strain only through gravity, being sure not to stir or push the oil through. This should take ~2hrs. Transfer to an airtight container and store in the refrigerator for up to 10 days.


Take solids from cheesecloth (remove bay leaf) and blend - makes great tapanade, fold into scrambled eggs, layer on pizza dough, etc
