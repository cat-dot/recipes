Sweet Potato Casserole
  --Cook's Country

1/3 c packed brown sugar
1 tsp grated orange zest + 2 tbsp oj
3 lbs sweet potatoes, peeled, and cut into 1 1/2" pieces
4 tbsp unsalted butter, cut into 6 pieces
1/4 c heavy cream
1 tsp salt
1/2 tsp cinnamon
1/4 tsp pepper
1/8 tsp cayenne pepper

Adjust oven rack to middle position and heat oven to 400F. Mix 3 tbsp sugar and 1/2 tsp orange zest together in small bowl until thoroughly combined; set aside. Lay 2 24x12" sheets of heavy duty foil perpendicular to each other inside rimmed baking sheet. Place sweet potatoes in center of foil and sprinkle with remaining sugar. Fold opposite sides of foil toward each other and crimp edges to seal tightly. Put baking sheet in oven and bake until sweet potatoes are tender, ~60 min. Remove baking sheet from oven and heat broiler. Carefully open 1 end of foil pouch, taking care to avoid escaping steam, and pour potatos and accumulated liquid in food processor. Add butter, cream, oj, salt, cinnamon, remaining zest, pepper, and cayenne and process until completely smooth, 30-60 s, scraping down sides as needed. Transfer potato puree to 2 qt soufle dish and sprinkle evenly with reserved sugar mixture. Broil sweet potatoes until topping is lightly browned and bubbling, 2-4 min. Serve. 


Notes: Processed potatoes can be refrigerated without topping for up 2 days. Cover with foil, bake on middle rack at 400F until hot throughout, 30-40 min; top with topping and broil.
