Fried Brussel Sprouts with Sriracha Dipping Sauce
  --Cook's Country

Sauce:
1/2 c mayo
1 1/2 tbsp sriracha
2 tsp lime juice
1/4 tsp garlic powder

Whisk all ingredients together in a bowl. Cover and refrigerate until ready to use.

Sprouts:
2 lb brussels sprouts, trimmed and halved through stem
1 qt vegetable oil
kosher salt

Line rimmed baking sheet with triple layer of paper towels. Combine Brussels sprouts and oil in large Dutch oven. Cook over high heat, gently stirring occasionally, until dark brown throughout and crispy, 20-25 min. Using spider or slotted spoon, lift Brussels sprouts from oil and transfer to prepared sheet. Roll gently so paper towels absorb excess oil. Season with salt to taste. Serve immediately with sauce.
