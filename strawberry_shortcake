Strawberry Shortcake

Chocolate Biscuits
2 c ap flour + exgtra for rolling
3 tbsp granulated sugar
2 tsp baking powder
pinch baking soda
1 tsp salt
8 tbsp cold butter, cut into 1/4" cubes
1/2c + 2 tbsp (3oz) chopped bittersweet chocolate
1/3 c buttermilk
1/3 c heavy cream

Line a baking sheet with parchment paper and preheat oven to 350F. In a large bowl, sift the flour, sugar, baking powder, and baking soda, then whisk in the salt. Add the chilled butter. Incorporate the butter into the flour by sliding the flour mixture in between the palms of your hands to create a flaky, coarse, mealy texture. Stir in the chocolat. Make a well in the center and add the buttermilk and cream, mixing with one hand until the dough is shaggy and begins to come together. Turn the dough onto a lightly floured work surface. Working quickly, gently press the dough together with your hands and, using a rolling pin, roll the dough out to an even 1" thickness. Fold once and re-roll to a 1" thickness. Using a 2 1/2" biscuit cutter, press traight down through the dough without twisting. Gather and pat down the scraps if needed. Place the biscuits onto the prepared baking sheet so they are just touching and chill in the fridge for 20 min before baking.
