Kuku Sabzi (Persian Herb Omelet)

5 tbsp canola oil, divided
1 finely chopped large yellow onion (about 1 1/2 c)
1 finely chopped medium leek (about 1 c)
kosher salt to taste
6 large eggs
2 tsp ap flour
1 tsp baking powder
1 tsp kosher salt
1 tsp freshly ground black pepper
1/2 tsp ground tumeric
1 1/2 c very finely chopped flat-leaf parsley
1 1/2 c very finely chopped dill
1 1/2 c very finely chopped cilantro
1 tbsp dried fenugreek (optional)
1 tsp ground dried rose petals (optional)
lavash bread, yogurt, fresh herbs and radishes, for serving

Heat 2 tbsp oil in a medium skillet over medium heat. Add the onions and leeks. Season with salt and cook, stirring occasionally, until very soft but not brown, 14-16 min. Remove from the heat and set aside to cool.
In a large mixing bowl, whisk together the eggs, flour, baking powder, salt, pepper, and tumeric. Using a rubber spatula, stir in the herbs and cooled onion-leek mixture.
Position the rack on the upper third of the oven and turn on the broiler. Heat the remaining 3 tblsp oil in a 10" nonstick oven-safe skillet over medium-low heat. Pour in the batter and spread evenly with a rubber spatula. Cook, covered, until the bottom has set, 10-12 min. Place the skillet under the broiler, uncovered, watching carefully until the top has completely set, 1-2 min. Remove from the oven.
Slide the kuku sabzi onto a serving platter and garnish with the rose petals. Cut the kuku sabzi into wedges and serve with lavash bread, yogurt, fresh herbs, and radishes.
