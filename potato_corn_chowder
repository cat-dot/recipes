  --Allen Dikker

7-9 small red potatoes, diced (~3 c)
2 tbsp olive oil
3 cloves garlic, lightly smashed
1/2 tsp salt + more to taste
1/2 tsp freshly ground black pepper + more to taste
4 c sweet corn kernels or 2x15oz cans sweet corn, drained
2 tbsp  maple syrup
2 tbsp unsalted butter
1 c chopped celery
1 c chopped yellow onion
3 canned chipotles in adobo sauce, chopped
3 tbsp ap flour
3 1/2 c chicken broth or stock
2 c whole milk
2 c shredded smoked gouda
microgreens for garnish

Preheat oven to 375F. In a bowl, toss the potatoes with olive oil, garlic, salt, and pepper. Transfer to a rimmed baking sheet and bake for 30-40 min, turning and tossing about halfway through, until potatoes re golden brown and crunchy. When the potatoes are ~halfway done, in a separate bowl combine the corn, syrup, and pinch each of salt and pepper and mix well. Transfer to a second rimmed baking sheet and place in the oven, on a separate rack from the potatoes, and bake for 15-20 min, until the corn starts to brown slightly. Remove both sheets from the oven and set aside. In large saucepan, melt the butter over medium high heat until the foaming subsides. Add the celery and onion, and saute until tender, ~5 min. Stir in the chipotles and flour and stir to blend well. Add the chicken broth and bring to a boil. Reduce the heat to medium low and simmer for 8-10 min. Reserve about a quarter of the potatoes and corn for garnish; stir in the remaining. Stir in the milk and bring back to a simmer, stirring often, for ~5 min. Reduce the heat to low and stir in the gouda, stirring until it melts completely. Taste and add salt and pepper as necessary. Ladle into shallow bowls & garnish with reserved potatoes, corn and microgreens.
