Buttermilk Pancakes
  --Jessie Damuck
  
1 1/3 c ap flour
3 tbsp sugar
1 tsp baking powder
1 tsp baking soda
1 tsp kosher salt
2 large eggs
1 1/4 c buttermilk
2 tbsp unsalted butter, melted
vegetable oil (for griddle)

Whisk dry ingredients in a large bowl. Whisk eggs, buttermilk, and butter in medium bowl; stir into dry ingredients until just combined (some lumps ok). Heat griddle or large skillet over medium; brush with oil. Working in batches, scoop 1/3 c batter onto griddle. Cook pancakes until bottoms are golden brown and bubbles form on top, ~3 min. Flip and cook until bottom is golden brown and pancake is cooked through, ~2 min. Keep pancakes warm in 250F oven between batches.
