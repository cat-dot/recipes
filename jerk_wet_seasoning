Jerk Wet Seasoning
  --Sam the Cooking Guy

1 bunch green onions, white & light green parts cut into 1" pieces
5 cloves garlic, peeled
1" piece fresh ginger, peeled and cut into slices
2 habanero peppers, stems removed and roughly chopped 
1/2 yellow onion, chopped
1/4 c brown sugar
2 tsp ground allspice
2 tsp ground ginger
2 tsp dried thyme
1 tsp cinnamon 
1 tbsp Kosher salt 
juice of 1 lime 
juice of 1 lemon
1 tbsp Worcestershire
1/4 c neutral oil 

Blend all ingredients until smooth. Makes ~2 c.



Notes: I didn't have a lime so used 2 lemons, also didn't have habanero, used a carribean red (which is 2x the heat of a habanero) and added a little more garlic.
