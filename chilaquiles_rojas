Chilaquiles Rojas with leftover turkey
  --Stephanie Alvarado

2 roma tomatoes, whole
1/2 white or yellow onion
4-5 garlic cloves, whole
4-8 dried chiles de arbol (depending on desired level of heat)
10 dried chiles guajillo, washed and deveined
1/2 tsp ground cumin
1/2 tsp garlic powder
1/2 tsp onion powder
Salt, to taste
Pepper, to taste
2 tbsp neutral cooking oil
4 eggs
3 c of shredded leftover turkey breast
Tortilla chips
Optional garnishes: avocado slices, radish slices, chopped cilantro, chopped white onion, crumbled queso fresco, crema

Boil the tomato, onion, garlic and dried chilies in a medium-sized pot until thoroughly cooked through ~10-12 min. Transfer these ingredients over to a blender, along with 1 c of the reserved cooking water, a little bit of salt, a little bit of freshly ground pepper, add the ground cumin, garlic powder and onion powder, and blend until completely smooth. Once completely smooth, check the sauce for seasoning and set aside. In a small saucepan, fry the eggs in 2 tbsp of oil to their desired doneness, season with a little salt and pepper, then set aside. While the eggs fry, add the tortilla chips to a large saucepan over medium-low heat and spoon the sauce and shredded turkey over the chips. Toss them very gently and carefully for ~1 min so that they're completely coated in the sauce, but also don't break in the process. Turn off the heat and set aside. Plate the chilaquiles and top with the fried eggs and any optional garnishes. 


Notes: can use chicken or anything really
