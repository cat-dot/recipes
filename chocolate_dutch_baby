  --Claire Saffitz

Dutch Baby:
3 large eggs
1/3 c ap flour
1/4 c sugar
3 tbsp unsweetened cocoa powder
3/4 tsp kosher salt
1/2 c whole milk
1 tbsp unsalted butter

Place rack in center of oven; preheat to 425F. Place a dry, medium, oven safe skillet on rack to preheat. Whisk eggs, flour, sugar, cocoa, and salt in a medium bowl until smooth. Whisking constantly, slowly stream milk in. Cover with plastic and let rest for 15 min. Remove skillet from oven and add butter; swirl skillet to melt, making sure to coat entire bottom and sides of skillet. Give batter a quick whisk to reincorporate, then pour into skillet. Quickly transfer to oven. Cook until pancake is dramatically puffed and edges are curling inward toward center, but center is still moist, 10-12 min. Remove skillet from oven and let rest ~2 min. 

Sauce:
1/4 c heavy cream
1 oz bittersweet, semisweet, or milk chocolate
salt

Chop chocolate and transfer to small saucepan. Add cream and cook over low heat, whisking often, until chocolate is melted and mixture is completely smooth; season with pinch of salt. Keep warm over low heat.

Can top with ice cream (optional) and drizzle with sauce to serve.
