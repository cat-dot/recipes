Corned Beef and Cabbage
  --Cook's Country

3 1/2-4 lb cornedbeef brisket roast, ~2" thick, rinsed, fat trimmed to 1/4"
1 tbsp pickling spice
1 1/2 lb red potatoes, unpeeled
1 lb carrots, peeled and halved crosswise
1 small head green cabbage (1 1/4 lb)
6 c water
4 tbsp unsalted butter, cut into 1/2" pieces

Set beef in slow cooker and sprinkle with pickling spice. Tuck potatoes and carrots between beef and sides of slow cooker. Cut cabbage into 6x2" wedges through core, leaving core intact so wedges stay together while cooking. Arrange cabbage on top of beef. Add water. Cover and cook until beef is tender, 6-7 hrs on high or 8-9 hrs on low. Turn off slow cooker. Gently push cabbage aside, remove beef from low cooker, and transfer to carving board. Tent with foil and let rest for 15 min. Cover slow cooker to keep vegetables warm while beef rests. Slice beef thin against grain; transfer to serving platter. Using slotted spoon, transfer vegetables to platter with beef. Dot vegetables iwth butter. Serve.


Notes: Be sure to buy first cut or flat cut brisket, not point cut. Potatoes should be <= 2" diameter
