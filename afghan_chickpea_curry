Melting Afghan Chickpea 
  --Nagi, recipetineats

3 tbsp ghee , substitute unsalted butter or coconut oil (for vegan)
2 cinnamon sticks (sub 1/2 tsp powder, add with other spices)
1 onion , finely chopped
1 1/2 tbsp grated ginger
1 1/2 tbsp grated garlic
2 bay leaves , preferably fresh else dried
1/2 c dried red split lentils
1 c water
1 litre vegetable stock, low sodium
1/2 tsp cooking / kosher salt
3 x 400g/14oz cans chickpeas, drained
1/4 tsp baking soda / bi-carbonate soda
Spices
1 tbsp coriander powder
1 tbsp cumin powder
1 1/2 tsp turmeric powder
3/4 tsp cardamom powder
1/4 tsp ground cloves

Melt the ghee in a large pot over medium high heat. Add the cinnamon and toast for 30 s. Add the onion, ginger, garlic and bay leaves. Cook for 3 min until the onion is translucent (stir regularly so the garlic & ginger don't catch). Add the spices and stir for 30 seconds. Add the lentils and stir to coat in the spices. Add the stock and salt. Stir, bring to a simmer. Lower the head to medium, put the lid on and simmer for 15 min. Add the chickpeas, water and baking soda. Increase the heat to make it simmer again. Then lower the stove slightly and leave to simmer gently for 30 min without a lid or until the lentils mostly broken down to make a thin gravy (you can cook an extra 10 min to thicken more if you want). Serve with rice on the side and Afghan or other flatbreads for dunking, drizzled with yogurt and sprinkled with fresh coriander if you want (I do).
