Black Sesame Soup
  --Maggie Zhu

2 tbsp (30g) glutinous rice 
1/2 c (75g) toasted black sesame seeds
4 tbsp brown sugar
5 c water, divided

Soak the rice for 4 hrs at room temp, or overnight in refrigerator. Add sesame seeds to large skillet and spread out in an even layer. Shake the pan over medium heat and toast until you can smell the fragrance, 2-3 min. Drain the rice and transfer to a blender, along with sesame seeds and 2 c water; blend until very smooth, 1-3 min depending on blender. Transfer to a medium saucepan, adding 3 c water. Bring to a boil over medium heat, stirring constantly. Once boiling, turn heat to low and add sugar and stir. Taste and adjust seasoning as desired. Can server now or let thicken to desired consistency.


Notes: Can use raw sesame seed, will need to toast longer. Can use other forms of sugar
