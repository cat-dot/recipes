Stuffed Parker House Rolls

3 tbsp + 1 tsp sugar
2 1/2 tsp (1/4oz packet) instant dry yeast
1/4 c 115F water
2 1/2 c bread flour
2 c ap flour
1 tbsp salt
1 c room temp whole milk
8 tbsp unsalted butter, melted and slightly cooled + more for brushing
1 tbsp olive oil
4 oz chinese sausage, roughly chopped
7 scallions, white parts only, thinly sliced

In a small bowl, whisk together the sugar and yeast until fully combined. While continuously whisking, stream in the water and mix until at least half the mixture is dissolved. Let rest for 10 min. In a medium bowl, whisk together the flours and salt. In the bowl of a stand mixer, add the yeast mixture, flour mixture, milk, and butter, and knead on medium speed for 5 min. Move the dough to a large greased bowl and cover with plastic wrap. Place in a warm area and allow to bulk proof until it has doubled in size, 1 hr. In a food processor, finely mince the sausage. In a medium skillet, heat the oil and add the scallions; sweat until translucent, 5 min. Add the minced sausage and cook until fully warmed through, 2 min. Chill the filling completely and set aside. Preheat ove to 350. Punch down the dough and portion into 16 evenly sized roung balls. Using a rolling pin, roll out a dough ball so it's 3" in diameter then stuff with 1 1/2 tsp of the filling. Close up the ball and place in an 8" greased square cake pan. Repeat the process with the remaining dough balls, cover the pan with plastic wrap and allow to proof for 30 min. Bake the rolls until they are golden brown in color, 20-25 min. Remove from the oven and brush generously with melted butter. Allow to sit for 10 min, then turn over the pan to release the rolls. Serve immediately or at room temp.
