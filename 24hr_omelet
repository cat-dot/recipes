24 Hr Omelet
  --America's Test Kitchen

3	tbsp unsalted butter, softened + extra for the baking dish
10	slices high-quality white sandwich bread
12	oz cheddar cheese, shredded (~3 c)
8	large eggs
3	c whole milk
1	small onion, grated over the large holes of a box grater
1	tsp salt
½	tsp ground black pepper
1	tsp dry mustard
½	tsp hot sauce

Butter the bottom and sides of a 13x9" baking dish (or shallow casserole dish of similar size). Spread the butter evenly over 1 side of each bread slice. Cut the bread into 1" pieces. Scatter half of the bread evenly in the prepared dish and sprinkle with half of the cheddar. Repeat with the remaining bread and cheese. Whisk the eggs in a large bowl until combined, then whisk in the milk, onion, salt, pepper, mustard, and hot sauce. Pour the egg mixture evenly over the bread and press lightly on the bread to submerge. Wrap the dish tightly with plastic wrap and refrigerate for at least 8 hr or up to 24 hr. Adjust an oven rack to the middle position and heat the oven to 350F. Unwrap the casserole and bake until puffed and golden brown, ~1 hr. Serve immediately.



Notes: Be sure to use a hearty white sandwich bread; our favorite is Pepperidge Farm Hearty White bread. The omelet needs to sit in the refrigerator, well covered, for at least 8 hours in order to achieve the desired consistency.
