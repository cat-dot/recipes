Sambal Paste
  --Harry Soo

1 c red onion, chopped
1/4 c fresh lemongrass, succulent part, finely chopped (or use pre-chopped lemongrass)
1/4 c fresh ginger, finely chopped 
3 tbsp fresh garlic, finely chopped
4 oz red curry paste
1 can coconut milk
3/4 c reconstituted tamarind pulp
1 c brown sugar
4 tbsp oil (as needed)

Heat half the oil in a saut√© pan, add the onion and lemongrass and cook until the onion is translucent and just starting to brown. Add the ginger to the pan and cook, stirring, until the ginger is quite fragrant. Add the garlic and, if needed, more oil to the pan. Cook ~2 min, until the garlic smell loses some of its harshness. Add the curry paste and stir to combine, cooking until the paste is well incorporated. Add ~1/2 the can of coconut milk and cook, stirring, until somewhat thickened. Squeeze the tamarind pulp, avoiding seeds if possible, into the mixture. Stir to combine. Add the sugar and the rest of the coconut milk. Simmer, stirring occasionally and adjusting seasoning to your taste, until the mixture is well thickened, almost spoonable. (It will thicken more as it cools.) Cool, store refrigerated in an airtight container.
