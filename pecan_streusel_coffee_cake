7 tbsp unsalted butter, cut into 7 pieces and softened
3/4 c milk

Adjust oven rack to lower middle position and heat to 350F. Grease and flour a 9" springform pan and place on rimmed baking sheet. In food processor, process flour, sugar, cinnamon, baking powder, baking soda, and salt until combined, ~10 s. Add butter and pulse until very small but visible pieces of butter remain, 5-8 5 s pulses. Add milk, egg, yolk, and vanilla; pulse until dry ingredients are moistened, 4-5 1 s pulses. Some small pieces of butter will remain. Transfer batter to prepared pan and smooth top with rubber spatula. Starting at edges of pan, sprinkle streusel in even layer over batter. Bake cake on sheet until center is firm and skewer inserted into center of cake comes out clean, 45-55 min. Transfer pan to wire rack and let cool in pan for 15 min. Remove side of pan and let cake cool completely, ~2 hrs. Using offest spatula, transfer cake to serving platter.


Notes: When checking for doneness, shake pan to ensure the center is set enough to support the streusel before poking with tester. Can make the night before, wrap unbaked cake with plastic, refrigerate, and bake following morning, increasing time by 15-20 min.
