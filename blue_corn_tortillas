Blue Corn Tortillas
  --Lily (Mexico to Ireland)

150g blue masa-harina
120-150mL hot water
1/8 tsp salt

Heat a large pan to high temp. Put masa and salt in a bowl and mix well with a fork. Pour in the hot water and incorporate the ingredients together until the dough comes together. As soon as it's cool enough to mix with your hands, use them to bring it all into one big bal of dough. Line a tortilla press with plastic. Make ball of the dough about the size of a golf ball. Place in the middle of the press, on top of the plastic; cover with another piece of plastic and press it to form the tortilla. Open and make sure it's the thickness/thinness you desire. Peel off the plastic and place into the hot pan. Cook for 10 s before flipping; cook second side 50-60 s, flip again. At this point it should slowly start to puff. Do not touch until it stops puffing or it collapses, at which point it is fully cooked and ready to eat or go into a tortilla cozy. Repeat with remaining dough. Leftovers - cool completely and wrap in a clean towel, stick in a ziptop plastic bag and keep in refrigerator for up to 4 days.
