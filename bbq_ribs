Sous-Vide Barbecue Ribs

2 tbsp kosher salt
2 tbsp smoked paprika
2 tbsp light brown sugar
1 tbsp ground cumin
1 tbsp ground cayenne
1 tbsp ground coriander
2x 2½ lb racks baby back ribs, cut in half crosswise
1 c barbecue sauce, homemade or store-bought

In a bowl, whisk together the salt, paprika, brown sugar, cumin, cayenne and coriander. Rub the mix on the ribs, coating both racks completely. Transfer the racks to 2 large vacuum-seal bags and seal shut. Alternatively, place the ribs in sealable plastic bags and dip them into a large bowl of water to displace the air before sealing shut. Preheat a pot of water fitted with a sous-vide immersion circulator to 155° according to the manufacturer's directions. Cook the ribs for 24 hrs, making sure the bag remains completely submerged. The next day, remove the ribs from the bags and light a grill. Grill the ribs, flipping often, basting them with the barbecue sauce until lightly charred, 6-8 min. Transfer to a cutting board and carve, then serve.
