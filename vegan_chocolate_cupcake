  - Martha Stewart

Cupcakes:
1 1/2 c ap flour
1/3 c unsweetened Dutch process cocoa
1 tsp baking soda
1/2 tsp coarse salt
1 c sugar
1/2 c coconut oil, measured in liquid form
1 tbsp instant espresso powder
1 c unsweetened almond milk, room temp
1 tsp vanilla
2 tbsp cider vinegar

Preheat oven to 375F. Line 12 c muffin tin with baking cups. In a large bowl, whisk together flour, cocoa, baking soda, salt, and sugar. In a separate bowl, whisk together oil, espresso powder, almond milk, and vanilla. Whisk wet ingrdients into dry until combined. Quickly stir in vinegar until incorporated. Divide batter evenly between cups (scant 1/3 c per). Bake until tops spring back when lightly touched, ~18 min. Cool 5 min in pan, then transfer to a wire rack to cool completely.

Frosting:
3/4 c maple butter, chilled (9oz jar)
3/4 c coconut oil, room temp in liquid form, but not warm

In the bowl of a stand mixer, on medium high speed beat maple butter until light and smooth, 1 min. Add oil 1 tbsp at a time, fully incorporating the oil before adding the next. If the coconut oil is not incorporating, transfer the bowl to the freezer for 1-2 min, to let the mixture set up. Return to the mixer and mix on medium high speed. Once all oil is fully incorporated, the frosting should be lighter in color and fluffy. Use immediately.
