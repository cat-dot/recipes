Fries:
1 c ap flour
2 tsp kosher salt
1/2 tsp freshly ground black pepper

1/2 tsp garlic powder
1/2 tsp onion powder
1/4 tsp cayenne pepper
2 eggs, beaten
2 c panko bread crumbs
2 lbs boneless, skinless, chicken breasts, cut lengthwise into 1/2" strips

In a medium bowl, whisk together the flour with salt, pepper, paprika, garlic powder, onion powder, and cayenne until incorporated. Transfer to a shallow dish, such as a pie plate. Transfer the beaten egg and panko to shallow dishes as well, then line up the 3 dishes next to each other in order of flour, eggs, and crumbs. One by one, dredge the chicken strips in the flour, followed by the egg and panko, making sure to completely coat the strips with each dredge. Place the fries on a plate until ready to fry. In a 6 qt pot or dutch oven, heat 2" of canola oil over medium heat until a deep fry thermometer reads 350F. Line a plate with paper towels and set aside. Working in batches, fry the chicken strips until golden brown and cooked through, 2-3 min. Remove the fried chicken and place on the prepared plate to drain, immediately season with salt. Transfer to a serving plate and serve immediately with the sauces on the side.
