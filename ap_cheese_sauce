All Purpose Cheese Sauce

1/4 c  raw cashews
1 1/4 c  diced peeled potatoes
heaping 1/3 c diced carrots
2-3 tbsp nutritional yeast to taste
2 tbsp refined coconut oil (or grapeseed)
2 tbsp + 1 1/2 tsp water
1 1/2 tsp fresh lemon juice or more to taste
1/2 tsp + 1/8 tsp fine sea salt or to taste
1 medium garlic cloves
1/2 - 3/4 tsp white wine vinegar to taste
sriracha or other hot sauce (optional)

Soak cashews in a bowl of water overnight or min 1 hr. Rinse and drain. Put the potatoes and carrots in a medium pot and add water to  cover. Bring to a boil over high heat, reduce to medium, and simmer uncovered for 10-15 min, until fork tender. Drain. (can also just steam the veggies). Transfer the cashews, potatoes, and carrots to a blender; add the nutritional yeast, oil, water, lemon juice, 1/2 tsp of salt, garlic, and vinegar, and blend. If it's too thick, you can add another splash of water or oil to help it along. Taste and add sriracha and more salt, if desired. The sauce will keep in an airtight container in the fridge for up to a week.
