Butter Mochi
  --Alana Kysar

unsalted butter or vegetable oil, for coating the pan
1 stick (8 tbsp) unsalted butter
1 lb mochiko flour (also known as sweet or glutinous rice flour)
2 c sugar
2 tsp baking powder
1/2 tsp kosher salt
2 c milk, any fat percentage
4 large eggs
2 tsp vanilla
13.5 oz can unsweetened coconut milk
1/2 c unsweetened shredded coconut
a few pinches of flaky salt (optional)

Arrange a rack in the middle of the oven and heat the oven to 350F. Coat a 9x13" baking pan with butter or oil. Melt 1 stick unsalted butter in the microwave or on the stovetop. Place mochiko, sugar, baking powder, and kosher salt in a large bowl and whisk to combine. Place milk, eggs, and vanilla in a medium bowl and whisk to combine. Pour the wet ingredients into the dry ingredients and, with a wooden spoon, stir until well combined. Add the melted butter and coconut milk and mix until fully incorporated and smooth. Pour the mixture into the prepared pan and rap the pan on the counter a couple of times to bring any air bubbles up to the surface. Evenly sprinkle shredded coconut on top of the mixture, a handful at a time, being careful not to jiggle the pan too much, as you want the coconut to stay on the top. Then sprinkle on a few pinches of flaky salt, if desired. Bake until the mochi is set and golden brown on top, 60-70 min. et the pan on a wire rack and let cool completely, ~1 hr. Slice into rectangles, using a plastic knife to minimize sticking; I cut 4 columns and 5 rows to make 20 2 1/4 x 2 1/2" pieces. If the knife seems to be sticking, rub it with a little unsalted butter or neutral oil. Store in an airtight container at room temperature for up to 3 days.
