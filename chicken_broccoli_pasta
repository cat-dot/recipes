Cheesy Chicken Broccoli Pasta

2 (6oz) boneless, skinless chicken breasts
salt and pepper
8 oz pasta shells
1 bunch broccoli, stems peeled and chopped, crowns broken into florets
2 cloves garlic, minced
1 c skim milk
2 tsp dijon mustard
1/4 tsp ground nutmeg
1/2 tsp salt
2 tbsp ap flour
1 1/2 tbsp oil
4 oz (~1 c) cheddar cheese, grated
pinch of cayenne or few drops of hot sauce (optional)

Bring a large pot of water to a boil. Tenderize the chicken breasts by piercing them all over with a fork. Chop, season with salt and pepper, set aside. Cook pasta as directed on the package. Add broccoli for the last 1 1/2 min. Drain, reserving 1 c pasta water. Meanwhile, mix garlic, milk, mustard, nutmeg, salt, and flour in a medium bowl; set aside. Heat a saute pan over medium high heat. Add oil and once hot, add chicken. Saute for ~4 min, until outside gets a bit golden. Remove chicken from pan and set aside. Return pan to heat and pour in sauce, scraping up any bits left behind in the pan. Once it starts to thicken, add in pasta, broccoli, chicken, and cheese. Stir until cheese melts and everything is mixed. Use reserved pasta water if mixture is too thick. Cook until chicken is done. Season with salt, pepper, and cayenne or hot sauce.
