Beer Battered Apple Fritters

5 tbsp granulate sugar
1 tbsp ground cinnamon
2 c ap flour
2 mutsu (crispin) apples - peeled, cored, and sliced into 1/2" think rings
1 c lager (preferrably brooklyn lager)
1/4 c grapeseed oil + extra for frying
1/2 tsp kosher salt
3 large egg whites

In a medium bowl, mix together the sugar and cinnamon and set aside. In another medium bowl, add 1/2 c of the flour, then dredge the apple rings through the flour, gently tapping off the excess. Place the apples on a plate and set aside. In yet another medium bowl, whisk together the remaining 1 1/2 c of flour, the beer, 1/4 c of the oil, and the salt. Use a stand mixer or hand mixer to whip the egg whites to stiff peaks, then gently fold the beaten whites into the flour mixture. Pour enough oil into a medium saucepan to fill it by 3" and heat the oil over medium high heat until it reaches 375F on an instant read thermometer. Dip 2-3 apple slices in the batter, then gently slide them into the oil, being careful not to overcrowd the pan. Fry until they are golden, about 2 1/2 min, reducing or increasing the heat as necessary to keep the oil temp between 365-375F. Flip the apples over and continue to cook the other side until the frittes are deeply golden brown, 3-4 min longer. Transfer the fritters to a wire rack set over a paper towel lined baking sheet and repeat with the remaining slices. After the fritters have 30 sec to cool, set them in the cinnamon sugar and turn to coat, then return to the wire rack to finish cooling.
