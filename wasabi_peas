Fresh Wasabi Peas

1/2 c finely grated fresh wasabi
2 tbsp mirin
2 tbsp rice vinegar
2 tbsp dry mustard
1 tbsp kosher salt
2 c freeze dried peas

Preheat oven to 225F and line a baking sheet with parchment paper. In a medium bowl, whisk together all ingredients except the peas. Add the peas and toss to coat. Stir the mixture gently so that all the pease are fully coated with the paste but not broken up. Arrange on the baking sheet, making sure that no peas are touching. Bake until dry, 60min. Let cool completely, then transfer to a bowl and serve.
