Chocolatey Poud Cake Bread Pudding
  --Erin Jeanne McDowell

Pound Cake:
1 c (226 g) unsalted butter, at room temperature + more for greasing the pan
1 1/2 c (297 g) sugar
3 (170 g) eggs, at room temperature
1 tbsp (15 g) vanilla 
3 c (360 g) ap flour
1 1/2 tsp (6 g) baking powder
1/2 tsp (2 g) fine sea salt
1 c (226 g) sour cream

If using store-bought pound cake, skip to making the bread pudding. If making pound cake, heat the oven to 325F/162C with a rack in the center of the oven. Grease a 9x9" baking dish with nonstick spray and line with parchment paper, leaving at least 1" of overhang on two of the sides (this will help you unmold the cake later). Grease the surface of the parchment paper and set aside. In the bowl of an electric mixer fitted with the paddle attachment, cream the butter and sugar until light and fluffy, 4-5 min. Add the eggs one at a time, mixing on medium speed to incorporate each. Scrape the bowl well using a rubber spatula after each addition is incorporated. Add the vanilla and mix until well combined. In a medium bowl, whisk the flour, baking powder, and salt to combine. Add ~1/2 of the flour mixture to the mixer, and mix on low speed to combine. Scrape the bowl well using the rubber spatula, then add ~1/2 of the sour cream, and mix on low speed to combine. Repeat this process, alternating the dry ingredients and sour cream until both are fully incorporated. Pour the batter into the prepared pan, and spread the batter into an even layer. Transfer to the oven and bake until a tester or skewer inserted into the center comes out clean, or with a few moist crumbs, 40-50 min. Cool for 15 min inside the pan, then use the parchment overhang to remove the pound cake and cool it completely on a wire rack. Once it’s cool, cut the pound cake into 1" cubes. If desired, spread them in an even layer on a baking sheet and let them dry for up to 2 days.

Bread Pudding:
1 tbsp (14 g) unsalted butter, at room temperature
2 (~1100 g) pound cake, cut into 1" cubes
12 oz bittersweet chocolate (I used 64%), coarsely chopped, divided
1 heaping c (~170 g) toasted nuts (such as almonds, pecans, walnuts, or hazelnuts), coarsely chopped (optional)
2 3/4 c (633 g) whole milk
1/2 c (66 g) sugar
2 tbsp (11 g) cocoa powder
1 c (235 g) heavy cream
4 (226 g) eggs
1 1/2 tsp (7 g) vanilla 
1/2 tsp (2 g) fine sea salt

Grease a 9x12" casserole dish generously with the unsalted butter. In a large bowl, toss the pound cake cubes, 6 oz (170 g) of the chopped chocolate, and the nuts (if using) to combine. Arrange in an even layer in the prepared baking dish. In a medium pot, heat the milk, remaining 6 oz (170 g) chocolate, sugar, and the cocoa powder over medium heat, whisking until the chocolate is fully melted. Transfer to a large heat-safe bowl or liquid measuring cup (preferably something with a pour spout). Add the cream to the chocolate mixture and whisk until evenly incorporated. Add the eggs and whisk until well combined, then add the vanilla and salt. Mix to combine. Pour the custard evenly over the pound cake mixture in the pan. Cover with aluminum foil, and transfer to the fridge for 1 hr (or up to 12 hr). Heat the oven to 350F with a rack in the center of the oven. Transfer the bread pudding to the oven and bake, covered with the foil, for 30 min After 30 min, remove the foil and bake for an additional 20-25 min until the custard appears just set and jiggles slightly in the center. Remove the bread pudding from the oven and cool for 10 min. If your ceramic pan has a lid, you can cover the baking dish to help keep the bread pudding warm until you’re ready to serve.
