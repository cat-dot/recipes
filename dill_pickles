"Kosher" Dill Pickles
  --Cook's Country

1 lb pickling (Kirby) cucumbers, each sliced lengthwise into 4 spears
1 tbsp kosher salt
1 tbsp black peppercorns
1 tbsp dried dill weed
6 cloves garlic, smashed
1/2 c chopped fresh dill leaves + 1 additional tbsp
1 1/2 c distilled white vinegar
1/2 c ice

Toss cucumbers with salt in colander set over bowl. Let stand 1 hr. Discard liquid. Place peppercorns, dill weed, garlic, and 1/2 c fresh dill in paper coffee filter or several layers of cheesecloth and tie tightly with kitchen twine. Bring spice bag and vinegar to boil in medium saucepan. Reduce heat to low and add cucumbers. Cover and cook until cucumbers turn dull olive-brown, ~5 min. Discard spice bag. Transfer cucumbers and liquid to glass bowl, add ice, and stir until melted. Stir in remaining 1 tbsp fresh dill. Refrigerate, uncovered, at least 1 hr before serving. (Pickles can be refrigerated in covered container for up to 2 weeks.)
