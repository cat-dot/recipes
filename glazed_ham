Apple Cider & Mustard Glazed Ham
  --Jody Williams
  
1 12-14lb cured smoked bine-in ham, skin removed if needed
4 c unfiltered apple cider
1/2 c honey
1 c brandy or cognac
4 thyme sprigs
1 shallot, thinly sliced
3 tbsp whole grain mustard
2 tbsp butter
kosher salt and pepper to taste

Preheat oven to 350F. Place the ham on a roasting rack fitted into a rimmed roasting pan. Score the top fat side with a knife, cutting down about 1/2" in the pattern of a grid. Pour 2 c water into the bottom of the roasting pan to help keep the ham moist. Set aside to rest at room temp until glaze is ready. In small saucepan, simmer vinegar until it's reduced to 1 c and has thickened into a shiny syrup. Stir in the honey, brandy, thyme, and shallots. Bring the mixture back to a simmer and reduce the glaze back to 1 c. Remove the saucepan from the heat and strain the glaze through a fine mesh sieve.Discard the shallots and thyme. Stir in the mustard and butter and taste for salt and pepper. Brush the ham with half the glaze and roast, basting every 20 min with pan juices. After 30 min in the oven, brush the remaining glaze over the ham. Tent with foil if browning too quickly, and roast until an instant read thermometer inserted into thickest part of ham registers 135F, 1 1/2 - 2 hrs. Remove from the oven and allow it to rest for min 30 min. Slice and serve.
