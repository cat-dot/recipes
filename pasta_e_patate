Pasta e Patate
  --Giulia Scarpaleggia
  
60ml (1/4 c) evoo + more for drizzling
1 white onion, minced
1 celery stalk, minced
1 clove garlic, minced
fine sea salt
565g (1 1/4lb) white potatoes, peeled and cut into 1/2" (1/2 cm) cubes
60g (2oz) pancetta, diced
1 litre (4 c) hot water, lightly salted
4 Roma (plum) tomatoes, diced
1 Parmigiano-Reggiano rind, ~5x2 cm/2x3/4" in
225 (2 c/16oz) pasta mista, ditali or other short, dried pasta
45g (1 1/2oz) aged provolone or Parmigiano-Reggiano, grated
140g (5oz) young provolone, cubed
freshly ground black pepper

Pour the olive oil into a large pot set over low heat. Add the onion, celery, garlic and a generous pinch of salt, and cook, stirring occasionally, until the vegetables are soft (~10 min). Add the potatoes and pancetta, stir, and cook for ~5 min, taking care not to brown the potatoes. Pour in 500ml/2 c of the hot water (it should be enough to cover the potatoes), add the tomatoes and Parmigiano-Reggiano rind, and cook over medium heat for ~25 min, stirring occasionally, until you can easily mash the potatoes against the sides of the pot with a wooden spoon. Pour in the remaining 480ml/2 c of hot water, add the pasta, and stir thoroughly. Bring to a simmer and cook until the soup has thickened and the pasta is al dente (~10 min). Remove the pot from the heat, add both cheeses and stir energetically to melt them. Taste and adjust the seasoning with additional salt and with pepper. Ladle the soup into warmed bowls, drizzle with olive oil, sprinkle with pepper and serve. The Parmigiano-Reggiano rind can be cut into small pieces and added to the bowls. Any leftover soup can be refrigerated for up to 2 days. Reheat gently over low heat, adding a bit of water as necessary to thin.
