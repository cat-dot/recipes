Pumpkin Cookies  - gf,df
  --Jessica Kellgren-Fozard

1/2 c creamy almond butter
1/2 c pumpkin puree
1 egg
1/4 c ground almond
1/4 c splenda
1 tsp cinnamon
1/4 tsp sea salt
1 tsp ginger
1 tsp vanilla

Combine all ingredients, dollop on to a baking sheet lined with parchment paper, flatten, bake at 350F for 12-15 min. Allow to cool completely before removing from baking tray.

Notes: To make vegan, sub 1/4 c almond butter for the egg. Can sub other sweeteners for splenda but if using syrup (like maple or agave), will be a looser batter. To make fancy, can press a whole almond into the center of the cookies.
