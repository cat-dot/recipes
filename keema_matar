2 tbsp vegetable oil
6 black peppercorns
4 green cardamom pods
2 black cardamom pods
1 cinnamon stick
1 red onion, halved and sliced thin crosswise
1 tsp grated garlic
1 tsp grated fresh ginger
1 lb 90% ground beef
3/4 tsp table salt
2 tsp ground coriander
2 tsp Kashmiri chile powder
1/2 tsp ground turmeric
1/2 tsp ground cumin
2x6 oz vine-ripened tomatoes, cored and chopped
1/4 c whole-milk yogurt
1 long green chile, halved lengthwise (optional)
1 c frozen peas
1/4 c chopped fresh cilantro + extra for garnish

Heat oil in medium saucepan over medium heat until shimmering. Add peppercorns, green and black cardamom pods, and cinnamon stick and cook, stirring occasionally, until fragrant, ~30 s. Add onion and cook, stirring occasionally, until onion is browned, 7-10 min. Add garlic and ginger and cook, stirring constantly, until fragrant, about 30 seconds. Add beef and salt. Increase heat to medium-high and cook, stirring to break up meat into very small pieces and scraping up any browned bits. Continue to cook, stirring occasionally, until mixture sizzles and bottom of saucepan appears dry, 7-12 min longer. Add coriander, chile powder, turmeric, and cumin and cook, stirring constantly, until spices are well distributed and fragrant, about 1 minute. Add tomatoes; yogurt; and chile, if using, and cook, stirring frequently, until tomatoes release their juice and mixture begins to simmer, ~2 min. Adjust heat to maintain gentle simmer. Cover and cook, stirring occasionally, until tomatoes have broken down and wooden spoon scraped across bottom of saucepan leaves clear trail, 12-18 min. Stir in peas and cook for 2 min. Stir in cilantro and season with salt and pepper to taste. If desired, remove cinnamon stick and cardamom pods. Transfer to serving bowl, garnish with extra cilantro, and serve.
