Instant Pot Applesauce

2 lbs (4 large) Granny Smith apples—peeled, cored and roughly chopped
2 lbs (4 large) Honeycrisp apples—peeled, cored and roughly chopped
1 c water
1 tsp lemon zest
½ tsp ground cinnamon
¼ tsp kosher salt

In the bowl of an Instant Pot, combine all of the ingredients and toss to mix. Close your Instant Pot, setting according to the manufacturer's directions, and cook over high pressure for 8 min. Once the Instant Pot has completely cooking, transfer the applesauce to a bowl and let cool completely. Stir to combine, then serve or store in a sealable container in the refrigerator.
