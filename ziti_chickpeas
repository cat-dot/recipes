Ziti Chickpeas with Sausage and Kale
  --Smitten Kitchen

Glug of olive oil
1 medium onion, chopped small
3 garlic cloves, minced
12 oz sweet or spicy Italian sausage, casings removed
Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper
1 tsp dried oregano
1 tsp red pepper flakes, or less to taste
28 oz can crushed tomatoes
15 oz cans chickpeas, drained and rinsed
6-8 oz bundle kale, stemmed, or 4-5 oz kale leaves, cut into thin ribbons
3/4 lb mozzarella, coarsely grated (see Note)
2/3 c finely grated pecorino cheese
Garlic bread, for serving, if you wish

Heat large sauté pan — if yours is ovenproof, you can even use it as your final baking vessel — over medium-high heat. Coat with a couple tbsp of olive oil, and heat oil. Add onion and garlic and cook until they begin to soften, ~4 min. Add ground sausage, 1 tsp of kosher salt, lots of freshly ground black pepper, oregano, and pepper flakes and cook, breaking up the sausage with your spoon into bite-sized pieces and browning them, ~6-8 min. Add tomatoes (beware the splatter) and chickpeas and bring mixture to a boil, then lower the heat to keep it at a simmer. Taste for seasoning; I usually add another 1 tsp kosher salt (Diamond brand) and more black pepper here. Simmer the chickpeas in the sauce for 10 min, or if you have more time, simmering them for 20-25 min softens them in a lovely way. If the mixture looks too thick, add 1/2 c water, 1/4 c at a time, until you get a thick but saucy consistency. Add kale and let it cook until wilted, 2-3 min. If you’re preparing the dish for later, or skipping the cheese on top, this is a great place to pause the recipe. You could even freeze it at this point. Heat your oven’s broiler. If your pan isn’t ovenproof, transfer chickpea mixture to a baking dish. Scatter the top with both cheeses and broil until the cheese is melted and browned in spots. Eat right away.
