  -- America's Test Kitchen

3 c ap flour
1 tsp baking powder
1/2 tsp baking soda
1/4 tsp salt
16 tbsp (2 sticks) unsalted butter, softened
1 1/2 c sugar
2 large eggs
1 c sour cream
2 tsp grated zest & 1/4 c juice from 2 lemons
2 tbsp cream cheese, softened

Adjust oven racks to upper-middle and lower-middle positions and heat oven to 375F. Line 2 baking sheets with parchment paper. Whisk flour, baking powder, baking soda, and salt in large bowl. With electric mixer on medium-high speed, beat butter and sugar until light and fluffy, ~2 min. Add eggs, 1 at a time, and mix until combined. Reduce speed to medium-low. Mix in sour cream and zest. Add flour mixture and mix until incorporated. Refrigerate until slightly firm, ~1 hr. Drop rounded tbsps of dough onto prepared baking sheets, spacing cookies 2" apart. Bake until just golden around edges, ~15 min, switching and rotating sheets halfway through baking. Cool on baking sheets. Repeat with remaining dough. 
Combine cream cheese and lemon juice in medium bowl. Whisk in confectionersâ€™ sugar until smooth. Top each cooled cookie with 1  tsp glaze.

Cookies can be stored in airtight container at room temp for 3 days.
