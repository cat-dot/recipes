Maple Roasted Carrot Salad

2 lbs carrots
olive oil
kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper
1/4 c pure maple syrup (grade A)
2/3 c dried cranberries
2/3 c freshly squeezed oj (~2 oranges)
3 tbsp sherry wine vinegar
2 garlic cloves, grated on a microplane
6 oz baby arugula
6 oz goat cheese, medium diced (ex. montrachet)
2/3 c roasted, salted marcona almonds

Preheat oven to 425F. Trim and scrub the carrots. If the carrots are more than 1" in diameter, cut them in half lengthwise. Cut carrots in large diagonal slices 1" wide x 2" long and place in a medium bowl with 1/4 c olive oil, 1 tsp salt, and 1/2 tsp pepper. Toss well and transfer to 2 sheet pans. Roast for 20 min, tossing once, until the carrots are tender. Transfer all the carrots to one of the sheet pans, add the syrup, toss, and roast for 10-15 min, until the edges are caramelized. Watch them carefully! Toss with a metal spatula nad set aside for 10 min. Meanwhile, combine the cranberries and orange juice in a small saucepan; bring to a simmer, then set aside for 10 min. In a small bowl, combine the vinegar, garlic, and 1/2 tsp of salt. Whisk in 3 tbsp oil. Place the arugula in a large bowl and add the carrots, cranberries with their liquid, goat cheese, almonds, and the vinaigrette. Toss with large spoons, sprinkle with salt, and serve at room temp.
