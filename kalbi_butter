Kalbi Compound Butter
  -- Ed Lee

6 tbsp soy sauce
2 tbsp granulated sugar
1 tbsp light brown sugar
1 tbsp sesame oil
1 tsp Korean chile flakes (gochugaru)
3 garlic cloves, minced
2 scallions, trimmed and finely chopped
1" piece ginger, peeled and minced
1 lb butter, softened

In a small saucepan, combine the soy sauce, sugars and sesame oil. Bring to a boil and cook for 5 min until thickened. Then let cool to room temperature. In a food processor, add the chile flakes, garlic, scallions and ginger, and pulse until finely chopped. Add the softened butter and pulse until combined. With the motor running, stream in the cooled soy sauce until a smooth compound butter forms. Using plastic wrap, roll the butter into a 1Â½" thick log and chill until firm before slicing into rounds.

Great on steak, roasted veggies, etc
