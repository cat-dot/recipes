Transfer each to a plate. To the pot, add sauerkraut, juniper berries, peppercorns, cloves, garlic, and bay leaves. Cook until warmed through and fragrant, 3 min. Add the reserved meat, the stock, and white wine, and bring to a simmer. Cook covered, until the meat is tender, 1 hr. Add the potatoes and continue to cook until tender, 25-30 min. Transfer meats to a cutting board and slice. Arrange on a platter with the braised sauerkraut and potatoes on the side. Serve with assurted mustards and crusty bread.
