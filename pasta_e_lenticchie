Pasta with Lentils

2 tbsp olive oil + more for serving
1 small yellow onion, finely chopped
1 medium carrot, peeled and finely chopped
1 garlic clove, finely minced
kosher salt and fresh ground black pepper to taste
1 c brown lentils, rinsed
1 tbsp tomato paste
3 thyme sprigs
1 fresh bay leaf
pinch crushed red pepper flakes
5 c water
8 oz short tubular pasta (ex. ziti, trenne, or rigatoni)
1/3 c whole milk
1 tbsp finely chopped flat leaf parsley

In a medium saucepan, heat the olive oil over medium high heat. Add the onion and carrot, and cook stirring often until soft but not brown, 3-5 min. Add the garlic and cook for 1 min. Season with salt and pepper and add lentils, tomato paste, thyme, bay leaf, and red pepper flakes. Cook for 3-4 min to allow the flavors to meld. Add the water and bring to a boil. Reduce the heat to medium low and simmer with the lid slightly ajar, until the lentils are tender, 40-45 min. Bring the lentils to a boil and add the pasta and milk. Cook, uncovered, stirring often so that the pasta doesn't stick to the bottom, until the pasta is al dente and the liquid has reduced to a creamy ragu-like sauce, 10-12 min. Discard the bay leaf and thyme sprigs. Garnish with parsley and parmesan cheese.
