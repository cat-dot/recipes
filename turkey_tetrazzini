Turkey Tetrazzini
  --Gourmet Test Kitchen, Epicurious

10 oz mushrooms, sliced thin (~4 c)
5 tbsp unsalted butter
1/4 c ap flour
1 3/4 c milk
2 c chicken broth
1/4 c dry white wine
10 oz spaghetti
3 c coarsely chopped cooked turkey, including cooked giblets if desired
1 c cooked peas
3/4 c freshly grated Parmesan cheese
1/3 c fine fresh bread crumbs

In a large skillet, saut√© the mushrooms in 4 tbsp of the butter over medium heat, stirring, until most of the liquid they give off has evaporated, stir in the flour, and cook the mixture over low heat, stirring, for 3 minutes. In a slow, steady stream, add the milk, the broth, and the wine, stirring, bring the mixture to a boil, stirring, and simmer the sauce for 5 min. In a large pot of boiling salted water cook the spaghetti until it is al dente and drain it well. In a large bowl combine well the cooked spaghetti, the mushroom sauce, the turkey, the peas, and salt and pepper to taste, stir in 1/3 c of the Parmesan, and transfer the mixture to a buttered shallow 3 qt baking dish. In a small bowl combine well the remaining 1/3 c Parmesan, the bread crumbs, and salt and pepper to taste, sprinkle the mixture evenly over the tetrazzini, and dot the top with the remaining 1 tbsp butter, cut into bits. (The tetrazzini may be prepared up to this point 1 month in advance and kept frozen, covered.) Bake the tetrazzini in the middle of a preheated 375F oven for 30-40 min, or until it is bubbling and the top is golden brown.
