Chocolate Bark

nonstick pan spray
3/4 lb semisweet chocolate (62%) finely chopped
1/4 lb bittersweet chocolate (82%) finely chopped
1/4 tsp flaky sea salt
3/4 c granola, divided
2 tbsp cacao nibs
2 tbsp coarsely chopped crystallized ginger

Lightly coat a 9x13" rimmed baking sheet with nonstick pan spray. Line the sheet with parchment paper, allowing the ends of the paper to hang loosely over the short edges of the baking sheet. In a large bowl, add the chocolates and the salt. Fill a medium saucepan with 1" of water and bring to a boil over high heat. Reduce the heat to low and place the bowl on top of the saucepan. Stir the chocolate often until it's completely melted and smooth, 3-5 min. Remove the bowl from the heat. Add 1/2 c of the granola and stir to combine. Pour the mixture onto the prepared baking sheet and use a spatula to spread the mixture in an even 1/4" layer. Immediately sprinkle with the remaining granola, the cacao nibs, and the ginger and refrigerate until hard, ~1 hr. Remoev the bark from the refrigerator and use the parchment overhang to lift it out of the baking sheet and set on a cutting board. Use a sharp knife to break the chocolate into pieces. Serve immediately or store in the refrigerator for up to 2 days.
