Guiness Cake with Irish Cream and Whiskey

Curd:
2 eggs
2 egg yolks
2 tbsp butter, melted
1/4 c sugar
1/3 c irish cream
1 tbsp whiskey

In a small bowl, whisk together the eggs and yolks. In a small saucepan, whisk the melted butter and sugar until combined, then add the eggs and irish cream. Place over low heat and stir constantly with a wooden spoon until thickened or a thermometer reads 170F. Remove from heat, strain, and stir in whiskey.

Cake:
2/3 c semisweet chocolate chips
1/4 c butter
1/4 c guinness (or other stout)
2 eggs
2 egg yolks
1/4 c sugar
1/2 tsp salt
1/3 c flour
confectioners' sugar for dusting

Preheat oven to 400F. Spray 4x6oz ramekins with nonstick spray. In a small saucepan over low heat, melt chocolate chips, butter, and guinness. In a medium bowl, whisk the eggs, yolks, sugar, and salt until pale yellow. Stir in the chocolate mixture until smooth, then add flour. Fill ramekins to 2/3 full. Add 3 tbsp of the curd to the center of each ramekin, then fill them to the top with the remaining batter. Bake for 14-16 min until the tops lightly spring back when pressed. Let cool on a wire rack for 5 min, then gently loosen cakes, invert onto a plate and dust with confectioners' sugar to serve.
