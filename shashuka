2 plum tomatoes, peeled and divided
5 tbsp olive oil, divided
½ yellow onion, peeled and halved
2 garlic cloves, roughly chopped
1 jalapeño—stemmed, seeded and roughly chopped
1 cinnamon stick
1 tsp cumin
28 oz can whole San Marzano tomatoes, crushed by hand
Kosher salt, to taste
4 eggs
cilantro for garnish
pita for serving

Preheat the oven to broil. Halve 1 of the plum tomatoes and place on a baking sheet. Toss with 1 tbsp of the olive oil and the onion. Roast, turning as needed, until lightly charred, 7 min for the tomato and 12 minutes for the onion. Roughly chop the remaining plum tomato. In a 12" cast iron skillet, heat the reamining 1/4 c oil over medium heat. Add the garlic, jalapeño, cinnamon stick and cumin, and cook until fragrant, 1-2 min. . Add the roasted vegetables, the chopped plum tomato and the canned tomatoes, and bring to a simmer. Cook until the tomatoes have broken down and the sauce has thickened, 20-25 min. Season with salt. Make 4 wells in the sauce and crack 1 egg into each. Season each egg with salt, then cover the pan and continue to simmer until the eggs are just set but still have runny yolks, 3-4 min. Garnish with cilantro leaves and serve with pita.
