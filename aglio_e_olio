Spaghetti Aglio e Olio with Shrimp
  --Cook's Illustrated

3/4 c evoo
2 lb shell on jumbo shrimp (16-20 per lb), peeled, deveined, and cut into 1" pieces; shells reserved and chopped coarse
4 qt water
1 lb spaghetti
2 tbsp + 1 tsp kosher salt, divided
6 garlic cloves, chopped fine
1 tsp red pepper flakes
1 c fresh parsley, chopped fine
1 tbsp lemon juice

Heat oil in dutch oven over medium high heat until shimmering. Add shrimp shells and reduce heat to medium. Cook, stirring occasionally, until shells turn deep orange and oil is rust colored and aromatic, 8-10 miin. Strain oil through fine mesh strainer into medium bowl, pressing on shells with spatula to extract as much oil as possible; discard shells. Wipe pot clean with paper towel. Set aside 2 tbsp oil and return remaining oil to pot. Bring water to boil in separate large pot over high heat. Add spaghetti and 2 tbsp salt and cook, stirring frequently, for 30 s. Continue to cook until pasta is al dente, 6-7 min. Drain pasta, reserving 1/2 c liquid. Meanwhile, add garlic, pepper flakes, and 1 tsp salt to dutch oven and cook over low heat, stirring occasionally, until oil begins to gently foam and garlic turns pale golden, ~6 min. Add shrimp and season lightly with salt. Increase heat to medium and cook, stirring frequently, until shrimp begin to turn pink and opaque, 3-4 min. Add pasta and reserved liquid and cook for 1 min, stirring frequently to evenly coat pasta. Off heat, stir in parsley and lemon juice and season with salt to taste. Serve, drizzling with reserved oil.
