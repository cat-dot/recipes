Pasta Scraps with Burrata, Sausage, Mushrooms, and Fennel

1 tbsp evoo (or leftover bacon fat)
3/4 lb mild or hot italian sausage, casings removed and sausage crumbled
1 medium shallot, thinly sliced
1 clove garlic, thinly sliced
1/2 fennel bulb, thinly sliced and fronds reserved
1 1/2 c cremini mushroom caps, sliced
1/4 c dry white wine
2 tbsp tomato paste
1 lb assorted pieces of leftover dried pasta
1 burrata
flaky sea salt

Place the oil in a large saucepan set over medium heat and warm. Add the sausage and cook until browned and cooked through, ~5-7 min. Remove the sausage from the pan and drain off the fat, leaving 1 tbsp in the pan. Add the shallot, garlic, fennel, and mushrooms to the pan and cook until translucent and tender, ~10 min. Add the wine and tomato paste and cook another 2 min. Add the sausage back into the pan and season with salt and pepper. In a large stockpot, bring salted water to a boil. Add the pasta and cook until al dente. Drain, reserving 1 c of the water. Add the pasta to the sausage mixture and ladle in a bit of the pasta water until the pasta is creamy. Spoon the pasta into 4 bowls, top with burrata, sea salt, and reserved fennel fronds and serve immediately.
