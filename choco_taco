Choco Taco Sandwiches

Shells:
¾ c ap flour
½ tbsp cocoa powder
¼ tsp baking powder
¼ tsp kosher salt
¼ c sugar
2 eggs
2 tbsp whole milk
½ tsp lemon zest
½ vanilla bean, seeds scraped
5 tbsp butter, melted and cooled, plus more for greasing

n a medium bowl, whisk together the flour, cocoa powder, baking powder and salt. In another bowl, combine the sugar and eggs. Using an electric hand mixer, beat until pale yellow and thick, 4 min. Stir in the milk, lemon zest and vanilla seeds. Gently fold in the flour mixture until just incorporated, followed by the melted butter. Heat a pizzelle iron. Working in batches, brush the iron with melted butter and add 1 tbsp of batter to each mold. Close cover; cook until the wafers are golden, 2 min. Fold the pizzelles into a taco shape, preferably using a taco shell mold, and let cool completely to harden. 

Filling:
4 c vanilla ice cream, softened

Line a sheet tray with parchment paper. Fill each shell with vanilla ice cream, then place on the sheet tray and freeze until set, 15 min.

Coating/Garnish:
1 c semisweet chocolate chips, melted
¼ c coconut oil
2 tsp corn syrup
Sliced almonds, for garnish
Crushed speculoos cookies, for garnish

In a small bowl, stir the melted chocolate, coconut oil and corn syrup until smooth. One at a time, dip the edges of the ice cream-filled tacos into the chocolate then return to the tray and sprinkle with the sliced almonds and crushed cookies. Let sit for 1 min for the shell to harden, then serve. If not serving immediately, wrap them in plastic wrap and return to the freezer. Serve within 2 days of making.
