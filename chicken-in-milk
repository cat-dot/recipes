Jamie Oliver's Chicken in Milk


Serves 4

One
3-pound (1 1/2-kilogram) organic chicken
Salt and freshly ground black pepper
4
ounces (1 stick or 115 grams) butter or olive oil
1/2
cinnamon stick
1
good handful fresh sage, leaves picked
Zest of 2 lemons, peeled in thick strips with a peeler
10
garlic cloves, skins left on
1
pint (565 milliliters) milk
Preheat the oven to 375Â° F and find a snug-fitting pot for the chicken. Season the chicken generously all over with salt and pepper and fry it in the butter or olive oil, turning the chicken to get an even color all over, until golden. Remove from the heat, put the chicken on a plate, and throw away the butter left in the pot (or save for another use). This will leave you with tasty sticky goodness at the bottom of the pan, which will give you a lovely caramel flavor later on. Put your chicken back in the pot with the rest of the ingredients, then cook it in the preheated oven for 1 1/2 hours. Baste with the cooking juice when you remember. (Oliver leaves the pot uncovered, but you can leave it partially covered if you'd like it to retain more moisture and make more sauce.) The lemon zest will sort of split the milk, making a sauce, which is absolutely fantastic. To serve, pull the meat off the bones and divide it on to your plates. Spoon over plenty of juice and the little curds. Serve with wilted spinach or greens and some mashed potato.
