Texas Red Chili

1/2 c lard or vegetable oil
1 c chopped white onion + more for garnish
8 garlic cloves, roughly chopped
2 red bell peppers stemmed, seeded and diced
2 green bell peppers stemmed, seeded and diced
1 vine ripe tomato cored and roughly chopped
2 1/2 lbs ground beef
3/4 c ancho chile powder
1/2 c cumin
1/4 c dried oregano
1/4 c paprika
kosher salt to taste
1 3/4 c beef stock
2 tbsp masa flour
2 tbsp warm water
sour cream for garnish
shredded cheddar and jack for garnish
crushed tortilla chips for garnish
cilantro leaves for garnish

In a large saucepan, heat the lard over medium high heat. Add the onion, garlic, peppers, and tomato, and cook until soft, 6-8 min. Add the ground beef and cook, breaking up the beef with a wooden spoon, until the meat is no longer pink, 5 min. Add the ancho chile powder, cumin, oregano, paprika, and a large pinch of salt, and cook until fragrant, 2 min. Pour in the stock and bring to a simmer. Cook until the liquid has reduced slightly, 30 min. In a small bowl, mix the masa flour with the water until a paste forms. Stir the paste into the chili and continue to cook until thickened, 15 min. Season with salt.
