Fusilli with Zucchini and Goat Cheese

3/4 lb whole-grain fusilli or rotini
3 tbsp olive oil, divided
2 medium (3.5oz) leeks, julienned
1/4 c + 3 tbsp heavy cream
1 medium (7 oz) zucchini, julienned
12 zucchini flowers, torn lengthwise, 3 saved for garnish
1/2 c goat cheese, divided

In a large pot of salted boiling water, cook the pasta per the package directions for al dente. Strain the pasta, reserving 1/2 c of the cooking water. Rinse the pasta in cold water until the pasta is completely cool, then toss with 1 tbsp of the olive oil and set aside. In a large saute pan over medium heat, add the remaining oil. Add the leeks and saute until the leeks are tender, 8 min. Add the heavy cream and bring to a simmer. Add the zucchini and flowers, and cook until tender, 3 min. Add the cooked pasta and 1/4 c of the cheese and toss until the sauce has fully emulsified. If the sauce needs to be thinned, add some of the reserved pasta water. Serve hot and garnish with the reserved torn squash blossoms and crumbles of the remaining goat cheese.
