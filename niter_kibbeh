Niter Kibbeh
  --Renards Courmets

21 oz unsalted butter, cut into cubes
1/2 small onion, chopped
3 cloves garlic, minced
1 tsp korarima (Ethiopian cardamom)
2 tbsp fresh ginger, minced
1 cinnamon stick
1/2 tsp beso bela (Ethiopian holy basil)
1/2 tsp koseret (Ethiopian oregano)
1 tsp whole black peppercorns
3 whole cloves
1 tsp fenugreek seeds
1 tsp coriander seeds
1 tsp cumin seeds
1/2 tsp ground nutmeg
1/2 tsp ground tumeric

Roast korarima, cinnamon, coriander, fenugreek, and cumin seeds for 3 min over medium heat, stirring regularly. Place all ingredients into a non-stick saucepan and bring to a boil over very low heat. Simmer for 90 min, being extremely careful not to burn the butter. Using a slotted spoon, skim off as much of the foam as possible. Strain the contents of the pan through a fine mesh cheesecloth or muslin. Pour the niter kibeeh into sterilized glass jars with airtight seals. Let cool completely and tightly close the jars. Can be stored at room temp for at least 3 weeks, in the refrigerator for 3 months, or several months in the freezer.
