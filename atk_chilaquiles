  --America's Test Kitchen

16 6" corn tortillas, cut into 8 wedges
1/4 c vegetable oil
salt
5	dried guajillo chiles, stemmed, seeded, and torn into 1/2" pieces (2/3 cup)
28 oz can whole peeled tomatoes
1 c finely chopped onion
1 poblano chile, stemmed, seeded, and chopped
1 jalapeno, stemmed, seeded, and chopped
3 garlic cloves, peeled and chopped
8 sprigs cilantro + 2 tbsp minced
1 1/2 lb boneless, skinless chicken breasts, trimmed
1 1/2 c chicken broth
4 oz queso fresco, crumbled
1 avocado, halved, pitted, cut into 1/2" cubes
2 radishes, timmed and sliced thin

Adjust oven racks to upper middle and lower middle and heat to 425F. Spread tortillas evenly in 2 rimmed baking sheets. Drizzle each sheet with 2 tbsp oil, sprinkle with 1/4 tsp salt, and toss until evenly coated. Bake, stirring occasionally, until tortillas are golden brown and crisp, 15-20 min, switching and rotating sheets halfway through baking. Toast guajillos in 12" cast iron skillet over medium heat until fragrant, 2-6 min. Transfer to blender and process until finely ground, 60-90 s.  Add tomatoes and their juice, 3/4 cup onion, poblano, jalapeno, garlic, cilantro sprigs, and 3/4 tsp salt to blender and process until very smooth, 60-90 s. Pound thicker ends of chicken breasts as needed to create even thickness. Combine blender mixture and broth in now empty skillet and bring to a simmer over medium high heat. Nestle chicken into sauce. Reduce heat to gentle simmer, cover, and cook until chicken registers 160F, 10-15 min, flipping chicken halfway through cooking. Transfer chicken to carving board, let cool slightly, then shred into bite size pieces using 2 forks. Meanwhile, increase heat to medium and simmer sauce until thickened and measures 4 c, ~6 min. Stir shredded chicken into sauce and cook until heated through, ~2 min. Off heat, stir in tortillas, cover, and let sit until tortillas have softened slightly, 2-5 min. prinkle with queso fresco, avocado, radishes, remaining 1/4 cup onion, and minced cilantro. Serve immediately.


Notes: New Mexican or Anaheim chiles can be substituted for the guajillo chiles.
