Millionaire's Shortbread
  --America's Test Kitchen

Crust:
2 1/2 c (12 1/2oz) ap flour
1/2 c (3 1/2oz) sugar
3/4 tsp salt
16 tbsp unsalted butter, melted

Adjust oven rack to lower-middle position and heat oven to 350 degrees. Make foil sling for 13x9" pan. Combine flour, sugar, and salt in medium bowl. Add melted butter and stir with rubber spatula until flour is evenly moistened. Crumble dough evenly over bottom of prepared pan. Using fingertips and palm of your hand, press and smooth dough into even thickness. Using fork, pierce dough at 1" intervals. Bake until light golden brown and firm to touch, 25-30 min. Transfer pan to wire rack. Using sturdy metal spatula, press on entire surface of warm crust to compress. Let crust cool until it is just warm, at least 20 min.

Filling:
14 oz can sweetened condensed milk
1 c (7 oz) packed brown sugar
1/2 c heavy cream
1/2 c corn syrup
8 tbsp unsalted butter
1/2 tsp salt

Stir all ingredients together in large, heavy bottomed saucepan. Cook over medium heat, stirring frequently, until mixture registers between 236 and 239F, 16-20 min. Pour over crust and spread to even thickness (mixture will be very hot). Let cool completely, ~2 1/2 hrs.

Chocolate:
8 oz bittersweet chocolate (6 oz chopped fine, 2 oz grated)

Microwave chopped chocolate in bowl at 50% power, stirring every 15 s, until melted but not much warmer than body temp, 1-2 min. Add grateed chocolate and stir until smooth, returning to microwave for no more than 5 s at a time to finish melting if necessary. Spread chocolate evenly over surface of filling. Refrigerate until chocolate is just set, ~10 min.  Using sling, lift out of pan and transfer to cutting board; discard foil. Using serrated knife and gentle sawing motion, cut shortbread. Can be stored at room temp, between layers of parchment, for up to 1 week.
