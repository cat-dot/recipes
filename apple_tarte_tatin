Apple Tarte Tatin

1 tbsp + 2 tsp unsalted butter
2 c sugar
1 tbsp light corn syrup
1 tbsp water
8 large (3-4 lbs) firm, tart apples, peeled
1/2 (17oz) package puff pastry sheets
flour

Generously butter the bottom and sides of a heavy 10" round cake pan. Set aside. In a 2 qt saucepan over medium high heat, combine butter, sugar, corn syrup, and water, and stir with a heat resisten spatula. Stirring constantly, heat until the mixture liquifies. Continue 1 min longer and immediately remove from heat; the mixture will be dark amber brown. Pour into buttered pan and set aside. Position oven rack to middle and preheat to 400F. Core an apple by slicing your knife vertically from top to bottom on either side of the core. Repeat with the remaining 2 sides of the apple. There will be 2 large sides and 2 small sides of apple. Discard the core. Repeat with the remaining apples. Arrange the larger pieces over the surface of the caramel in the cake pan. Arrange the remaining apple sides over and around the larger pieces. Place the pan in the middle of the baking sheet in the center of the oven for 50 min or until apples are tender. Lightly flour a countertop and gently unfold the puff pastry sheet. Roll out the edges to make a 10" square. Prick the pastry surface 30 times, creating small holes over the surface of the pastry. Place on a baking sheet lined with plastic wrap. Place in refrigerator until needed. After the apples are tender, gently lay the pastry over the apples and tuck in the sides of the pastry around the apples. Place in the oven and bake another 30 min, or until pastry is golden brown. Remove from oven and allow to cool for 30 min. Place a 12-14" flat serving platter top side down over tart. Invert the tart onto the platter, being very careful of hot caramel. Allow pan to sit upside down for 2-3 min before removing.
