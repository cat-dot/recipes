1 tbsp coarsely grated paremsan + more for serving
1/2 tsp dried oregano
1/4 tsp garlic powder
1/4 tsp crushed red pepper flakes + more
kosher salt
1 large egg, beaten
5 tbsp heavy cream
1 lb ground beef chuck (80/20)
2 tbsp olive oil
1/2 medium onion, finely chopped

freshly ground black pepper
2 tbsp tomato paste
2 tsp sweet paprika
1 tbsp sugar

Puree tomatoes in a food processor until mostly smooth; there should still be some dime sized pieces remaining; set aside. Whisk panko, cheese, oregano, garlic powder, 1/4 tsp red pepper flakes, and 1 1/2 tsp salt in a medium bowl. Whisk in egg and cream. Add beef and mix with your hands (or 2 forks) until just combined, being careful not to overwork. Form into 1" diameter balls, should make ~24; transfer to a plate. Heat oil in a large skillet, preferrably cast iron, over medium high. Cook meetballs, turning occasionally, until lightly browned on all sides but not fully cooked through, ~5 min. Transfer to another plate. Cook onion and garlic in same skillet, stirring occasionally, until onion is translucent and begins to soften, ~5 min; season with salt and pepper. Add tomato paste and cook until brick red, ~1 min. Add paprika and a pinch of red pepper flakes and cook until fragrant, ~1 min. Add sugar, basil, and reserved tomato puree. Reduce heat and simmer until sauce is slightly reduced and flavors have melded, ~20 min. Add meatballs and any accumulated juices; continue to cook until meatballs are cooked throuhg, 5-10 min. Meanwhile, cook pasta in large pot of salted boiling water, stirring occasionally, until al dente (per package instructions). Drain and return pasta to pot. Pour sauce and meatballs over pasta and stir to combine. Transfer to serving dish and top with cheese.
