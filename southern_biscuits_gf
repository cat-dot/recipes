Southern Biscuits gluten free
  --Laurel Gallucci

2 tbsp coconut butter, cubed
2 tbsp coconut oil, solid
2 1/2 c almond flour
1 tbsp baking powder
1/2 tsp himalayan pink salt
3/4 c coconut yogurt
1 large egg, beaten

Preheat oven to 350F; line a baking sheet with parchment paper. Combine the butter and oil in a small bowl and chill in the freezer for ~5 min. In a medium bowl, whisk together the flour, baking powder, and salt. Add the chilled fat and cut in using a pastry blender, until a meal forms. It will look like wet sand, and the fats should be pea-sized. Stir in the yogurt. Loosely form the dough into a ball and place on a sheet of parchment paper. Cover the dough with a second sheet of parchment paper and press into a 3/4" thick rectangle. Fold the dough over itself in 3 sections. Again pat down the dough until it's 3/4" thick, and repeat this entire process 2 more times. This creates the fluffy layers that will puff and add lift. Press out the folded dough so it's 1" thick, and cut out biscuits with a 3" round cookie cutter. Place the rounds on the prepared baking sheet. Using a pastry brush, lightly coat the top of each biscuit with the egg. Bake for ~15 min, or until puffed up and golden. Allow to cool or serve warm.

Notes: makes 8 3" biscuits
