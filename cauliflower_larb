  --Olive Magazine

1 small cauliflower, broken into florets
groundnut oil
4 stalks lemongrass, woody outer leaves removed and finely chopped
1 garlic clove, chopped
1 small red chili, chopped
1 tbsp palm or soft brown sugar
3 limes, juiced
1 tbsp fish sauce or shoyu
1 small red onion, finely chopped
small bunch of cilantro (coriander) chopped, reserve some leaves for garnish
4 leaves little gem lettuce

Put the cauliflower into a food processor and pulse gradually until you achieve a rice-like consistency. Heat 2 tbsp oil in a large frying pan. Add the lemongrass and fry for about 2 min until soft. Add the cauliflower and cook for 3-4 min. Whizz the garlic, chilli and sugar in a small food processor, then add the lime juice and fish sauce and whizz again. Pour over the cauliflower and stir in the onion and coriander. Pile onto a bed of lettuce and scatter with more coriander to finish.
