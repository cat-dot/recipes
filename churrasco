2 lbs (8 links) linguica
2 lbs (7 each) tiger prawns
1 c olive oil
1 c (30 cloves) garlic, roughly chopped
1 c oj
1/4 c lime juice
1/4 c lemon juice
1 tbsp fresh oregano, roughly chopped
2 tsp salt
1 tsp light brown sugar
1/2 tsp cinnamon
1 red onion, thinly sliced
kosher salt and freshly ground pepper to taste
3x1lb top sirloin steaks

In a large bowl, combine all the ingredients except the steaks, toss to incorporate. Let marinate for 1hr. Skewer the steaks on a large metal skewer, curving them to form a C shape.

Chimichurri:
1 lb (3 bunches) scallion,s trimmed
1/2 c parsley leaves, minced
1/4 c olive oil, divided
2 tbsp lemon juice
2 tsp lemon zest
1/2 tsp oregano, minced
1 fresno chile, stemmed, seeded, and minced

Light a grill. Cook the scallions, turning often, until lightly charred and slightly wilted, 4-6 min. Transfer to a cutting board and let cool. Mince the scallions then transfer to a small bowl. Whisk in the remaining ingredients until a smooth sauce comes together.

Season the skewered steaks with salt and pepper and place on the grill with the sausage and prawns. Cook, turning occasionally until all the meats are lightly charred, the prawns are cooked through, and the steak is medium rare, ~15 min. Transfer to a board and let rest for 5 min, then carve and serve with the chimichurri.
