Toaster Oven Mac and Cheese
  --America's Test Kitchen
  
6 oz (1 1/2 c) elbow macaroni
1 (12 oz) can evaporated milk
1/2 c water
1/2 tsp dry mustard
1/4 tsp table salt
1/8 tsp pepper
3 oz sharp cheddar cheese, shredded (3/4 c)
3 oz American cheese, shredded (3/4 c)
1/4 c panko bread crumbs
2 tsp extra-virgin olive oil
2 tbsp grated Parmesan cheese
2 tsp minced fresh parsley, basil, or chives (optional)

Adjust toaster oven rack to middle position and heat oven to 375F. Spread macaroni into greased 8‑inch square baking dish or pan. Whisk evaporated milk, water, dry mustard, salt, and pepper together in bowl. Pour into baking dish and stir gently to combine. Cover dish tightly with aluminum foil and bake, stirring occasionally, until macaroni is nearly tender, 30-35 min, rotating dish halfway through baking. Remove dish from oven and stir macaroni thoroughly, scraping sides and bottom of dish. Stir in cheddar cheese and American cheese. Cover dish with foil and bake until macaroni is tender and cheese is melted, 10-15 min (mixture will seem loose). Remove dish from oven. Stir to coat pasta evenly in sauce, and let cool while preparing topping. Toss panko with oil in bowl until evenly coated, then microwave, stirring occasionally, until deep golden brown, 1-4 min. Transfer dish to wire rack and let cool for 5 min, then stir in Parmesan and parsley, if using. Sprinkle casserole with panko and serve.


Notes: This recipe can be easily doubled using a 13 by 9‑inch baking pan; increase covered baking time to 35-40 min.
