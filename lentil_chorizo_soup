Slow Cooker Lentil Chorizo Soup
  --Cook's Country

4 c chicken broth
14.5 oz can diced tomatoes, drained
8 oz Spanish-style chorizo sausage, sliced ¼ inch thick
1 c dried brown lentils, picked over and rinsed
1 onion, chopped fine
2 carrots, peeled and chopped fine
1/2 c dry white wine
3 garlic cloves, minced
3 sprigs fresh thyme
1 tsp ground cumin
1 tsp ground coriander
1/2 tsp table salt
1/2 tsp ground cinnamon
1/4 tsp cayenne pepper
1 bay leaf

Combine all ingredients in slow cooker. Cook until lentils are tender, 5-6 hr on high or 7-8 hr on low. Discard thyme sprigs and bay leaf. Serve.


Notes: For the best results, use a dry-cured Spanish-style chorizo in this recipe. If Spanish-style chorizo is unavailable, you can substitute Portuguese linguiça sausage.
