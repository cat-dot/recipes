Crust:
8 whole graham crackers, broken into smaller pieces
2 tbsp sugar
5 tbsp unsalted butter, melted

Adjust oven rack to middle position and heat oven to 350F. Pulse crackers and sugar in food processor until finely ground. Add melted butter in steady stream while pulsing until crumbs resemble damp sand. Using bottom of dry measuring cup, press crumbs firmly into bottom and sides of 9" pie tin. Bake until fragrant and browned around edges, 12-14 min. Cool completely.

Filling:
1/4 c sugar
1 tbsp grated lime zest
8 oz cream cheese, softened
14 oz can sweetened condense milk
1/3 c instant vanilla pudding mix (does not require stovetop cooking)
1 1/4 tsp unflavored gelatin
1 c fresh lime juice (6-8 limes)
1 tsp vanilla

Process sugar and zest in food processor until sugar turns bright green, ~30 s. Add cream cheese and process until combined, ~30 s. Add condensed milk and pudding mix and process until smooth, ~30 s. Scrape down sides of bowl. Stir gelatin and 2 tbsp lime juice in small bowl. Heat in microwave for 15 s; stir until dissolved. With machine running, pour gelatin mix, remaining lime juice, and vanilla through feed tube and mix until thoroughly combines, ~30 s. Pour filling into cooled crust, cover with plastic, and refrigerate at least 3 hrs or up to 2 days. To serve, let pie sit at room temp for 10 min before slicing.
