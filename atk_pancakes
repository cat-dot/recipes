Add wet to dry, mix lightly (there will be lumps, do not overmix) and let rest for 10 min. Oil griddle evenly (use paper towel to create even layer - no puddles), heat to 350F. Cook pancakes ~2-3 min on first side, flip, ~1-2 min on second side. To keep warm while making all, place finished pancakes on a wire rack in a rimmed baking sheet in a 200F oven.
