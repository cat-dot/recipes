Saag Feta
  --Priya Krishna 
  
2 tbsp whole coriander seeds
2 green cardamom pods
1/4 c + 2 tbsp ghee divided
1 onion, diced
1 garlic clove, minced
1 tbsp chopped fresh ginger
1 lb fresh spinach, rinsed and drained
1 serrano chile, chopped
1/4 tbsp lime juice
1 tsp salt
6 oz fets, cut into cubes
1 tsp cumin seeds
pinch red chile powder

Saute coriander and cardamom in 1/4 c ghee on medium heat until they start to brown. Add onion, cook until translucent, then mix in garlic, ginger, and spinach.Once spinch has wilter, remove pan from heat; add serrano, lime juice, and salt and put everything into a blender and blitz into a chunky paste. Return mixture to pan on low heat along with half a cup of water (pro tip - use water to rinse out blender), and fold in feta. While that warms up, in a small pan, add 2 tbsp ghee and cumin seeds on medium high heat. Once seeds start to brown, add a pinch of chile powder and pour mixture (chhonk) over saag. Serve with rice or roti (or both)
