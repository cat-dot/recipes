Cook quinoa in medium saucepan over medium-high heat, stirring frequently, until very fragrant and making continuous popping sounds, 5-7 min. Stir in 1 2/4 c water and 1/2 tsp salt and bring to simmer. Reduce heat to low; cover; and simmer until quinoa is tender and water is absorbed, 18-22 min, stirring halfway through cooking. Remove saucepan from heat and let sit, covered, for 5 min. Gently fluff with fork and set aside to cool slightly. Meanwhile, whisk 1/2 c hummus, lemon juice, and 4 tsp olive oil together in bowl. Season with salt and pepper to taste; set aside hummus sauce until ready to serve. Combine chicken, 1 c cooled quinoa, lemon zest, 1/2 tsp salt, 1/4 tsp pepper, and remaining 1/4 c hummus in large bowl. Using your wet hands, gently knead until combined. Pinch off and roll mixture into 20 tightly packed 1 1/2" wide meatballs. Heat 3 tbsp oil in 12" nonstick skillet over medium-high heat until shimmering. Add meatballs and cook until well browned and cooked through, 9-11 min, turning gently as needed. Transfer meatballs to plate and tent with aluminum foil to keep warm. Add carrots, 3 tbsp water, and 1/4 tsp salt to now-empty skillet. Cover and cook over medium-high heat for 2 min. Uncover and cook until carrots are tender and spotty brown, 3-4 min. Stir in remaining 3 c cooled quinoa; reduce heat to medium; and cook until quinoa is warmed through, ~2 min. Stir in 1 tbsp oil and season with salt and pepper to taste. Sprinkle quinoa with carrot greens, drizzle with olive oil to taste, and serve with meatballs and hummus sauce.
