Baked Churro Bars  gf, non-dairy
  --Laurel Gallucci

Topping:
1/4 c date sugar
1 tbsp cinnamon

Mix in small bowl and set aside.

Cake:
3 c almond flour
1 tsp baking soda
1/2 tsp himalayan pink salt
1/2 c finely chopped pecans or pecan flour
2 large eggs
1/2 c maple syrup
1/2 c coconut oil, melted
1 tbsp vanilla

Preheat oven to 350F. Line a 8x8" baking pan with parchment paper, letting the paper hang over the sides for easy removal. In a medium bowl, mix the flour, baking soda, salt, and pecans. In a large bowl, mix the eggs, syrup, oil, and vanilla. Pour the dry ingredients into the wet, stirring to combine. Pour the batter into the prepared pan. Sprinkle with the topping and bake for 30-35 min, until golden brown and a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean. Allow the cake to cool fully in the pan. Remove by gently lifting up on the parchment paper, then cut into thin slices, ~1x4". Sprinkle with additional date sugar if you like.

Cacao:
1/2 c chopped unsweetened baking chocolate
1 c full fat coconut milk
1/4 c maple syrup
1 tsp vanilla
pinch of himalayan pink salt

Combine all ingredients in a small pot over low heat. Stir gently until everything is melted, steaming, and well combined, ~10 min. Can dip or drink, but keep in mind a little goes a long way.
