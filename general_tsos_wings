  --Dale Talde

Marinade:
2 egg whites
3 tbsp dark shoyu
3 tbsp shaoxing wine
3 tbsp chornstarch
2 lbs chicken wings

In a large bowl, whisk the egg whites to soft peaks. Whisk in the shoyu, wine, and cornstarch, and then toss the chicken wings in. Cover and refrigerate overnight.

Sauce:
2 tbsp vegetable oil
6 tbsp minced garlic
1/4 c minced ginger
1 c sugar
3/4 dark shoyu
1/2 c rice wine vinegar
1/2 c chicken stock
1/4 c bean sauce (tobanjan)
2 tbsp chile oil
10 dried thai chiles
4 scallions, minced
3 tbsp cornstarch

In a 3 qt saucepan, heat the oil over medium heat. Add the garlic and ginger, and cook until fragrant and beginning to caramelize, 4-5 min. Stir in the sugar, shoyu, vinegar, stock, and bean sauce. Bring to a simmer, then add the chile oil, dried chiles and scallions. Once simmering, transfer 3 tbsp of the liquid to a small bowl. Stir in the cornstarch until smooth, then stir that into the simmering pot. Cook until thickened, 1-2 min, then removed from the heat. Keep warm until ready to toss.

Frying:
1 c cornstarch
sesame seeds, for garnish
thinly sliced scallions, for garnish

In a 6 qt dutch oven, heat 2" of oil to 300F and line a plate with paper towels. Drain the wings and transfer to a large bowl with the cornstarch. Toss to coat completely. Working in 2 batches, fry the wings until crispy and cooked through, 6-8 min, letting the oil return to temp between batches. Transfer the wings to the prepared plate to drain, then toss in the sauce to coat. Place on a serving platter, garnish with sesame seeds and scallions, and serve.
