One Pot Creamy Spinach Lentils

2 tbsp butter/oil/bacon grease
1/2 yellow onion, diced
2 carrots, peeled and chopped
2 celery ribs, chopped
1/2 c dry white wine
2 c uncooked lentils, rinsed
2 medium yukon potatoes, chopped (1c)
4 c chicken broth + more as needed
1 bay leaf
few sprigs of fresh parsely
few sprigs of fresh thyme
1/2 c half and half
3-4 c packed fresh baby spinach
salt and pepper to taste
olive oil and red wine vinegar for topping

Heat the oil over meidum heat. Add the onions, carrots, and celery. Saute for 10 min until the vegetables are nice and roasty and fragrant. Add the wine slowly - it should give a little sizzle and get all te browned bits off the bottom. Add the lentils, potatoes, and broth. Tie the bay leaf, parsley, and thyme together and toss in the pot (makes for easy removeal). Simmer for 30-45 min, stirring occasionally, adding more broth as necessary so the lentils are just barely covered in liquid. When the lentils and potatoes are soft, gently mash the potatoes against the side of the pot with the back of a wooden spoon to make the mixture creamy. Remove the herb bundle; add the half and half and spinach. Stir to incorporate. Season with salt and pepper.
