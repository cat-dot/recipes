Plum Lavender Pie

2 tsp dried lavender flowers
1 tsp kosher salt
2 1/2 lbs (8 medium) santa rosa plums, pitted and cut into 1/2" wedges
1/2 c granulated sugar
1/4 c cornstarch
1/4 c prunes, roughly chopped
2 tbsp lemon juice
1 tsp lemon zest
1 flay piecrust
1 egg, beaten
1 tbsp turbinado sugar

In a mortar and pestle, grind together the lavender flowers and salt into a fine powder. Transfer to a large bowl with the plums, sugar, cornstarch, prunes, lemon juice, and zest. Toss to coat and let sit at room temp for 30 min, tossing every 10 min. Preheat oven to 350F. Strain the plums of any liquid that has accumulated and transfer the liquid to a small saucepan over medium high heat. Cook, stirring constantly, until the liquid has thickened, 2-3 min. Then add it back to the bowl of plums and toss to incorporate. On a lightly floured surface, roll out 1 disk of pie dough into a 12" circle. Transfer to a 9" pie tin, pressing to fit the tin, leaving at least 1" overhang on the sides. Spoon the filling into the tin over the dough, spreading to make an even layer. Roll out the other disk into a 10" square. Using a knife or a fluted pastry cutter, cut 8 1" strips of dough. Place 4 strips horizontally across the plums, then pull alternating strips back and lay the additional strips perpendicular. Trim off extra dough, then roll up the edge to make a rim around the dish. Using your fingers, crimp the edges of the pie. Brush the dough liberally with the beaten egg, then sprinkle the turbinado sugar over the top. Bake until the crust is golden brown and the filing has thickened, 1hr - 1hr 10min. Remove from the oven and let cool completely before serving.
