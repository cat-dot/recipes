Dad's Muffins
  -- Jim Unmack, transcribed by Carol Unmack
  
2 c ap flour
2 1/2 tsp baking powder
1/2 tsp baking soda
1/2 tsp salt
2 c buttermilk
3/4 c oil

Optional ingredients:
1 c chopped nuts
1 c date crystals (can use fresh)
1 c chocolate chips
1/2 c corn meal
1 c blueberries
2 eggs
2 tbsp poppy seed
2 tbsp sesame seeds
1/4 c cocoa (unsweetened)
1 c oatmeal
1 c raisins
1 c diced canned fruit

Preheat oven to 400F. Mix dry ingredients in one bowl, wet in the other. Combine wet with dry (muffin method), do not overmix. Divvy up the batter in greased muffin tin, the number of muffins will depend on how many optional ingredients you use, makes ~18-24 depending on the size with date crystals, nuts, chocolate chips, and cocoa. Bake for ~12 min.


Notes: Recipe is very forgiving, will tolerate almost any combination of optional ingredients. I've found the cocoa quantity isn't enough for very much chocolate flavor. Cornmeal adds crispness; oatmeal makes muffins soft; eggs add toughness - usually only add with fruit.
