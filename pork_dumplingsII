Pork and Chive Dumplings

Sauce:
1/2 c shoyu
1/2 c black vinegar
1 tbsp sesame oil
2 tsp toasted white sesame seeds

In a medium bowl, combine all the ingredients and set aside until ready to serve. Makes ~1 c.

Dumplings:
1 lb ground pork
1 c finely chopped garlic chives
2 tsp minced garlic
1 1/4 tsp salt
1 tsp cornstarch
1 tsp grated ginger
1 tsp freshly ground black pepper
30 3 1/2" round dumpling wrappers
canola oil for frying

In a medium mixing bowl, combine all the ingredients except for the wrappers and canola oil, using a rubber spatula to mix everything. Working with one dumpling wrapper at a time, place a tsp of the filling in the center of the wrapper and fold in half. Pinch the dumpling at one end before guiding one edge over and folding it to form a pleat, making sure to pinch as you go until you have a total of 6 pleats and the dumpling is closed. Transfer to a parchment lined baking tray and repeat the process for the remaining dumplings until all the filling has been used. Cover them with a damp paper towl until ready to cook. In a large nonstick skillet, heat 2 tbsp of oil over medium high heat. Working in 3 batches, arrange the dumplings in a single layer and cook until the bottoms begin to brown, about 1 min. Pour 1/2 c water into the pan, cover with a lid and seam until the filling is almost cooked through, about 2 min. Cover and cook until all the water has evaporated and the bottoms have become golden brown and crisp, about 2 min.
