  --Jessica Kellgren-Fozard

Paste:
2 tbsp oil
2 red chilies, de-seeded
1" ginger, roughly chopped
2 stalks lemon grass (or 1 tsp lemon grass paste)
2 tsp unsweetened peanut butter
400ml coconut water
400 ml water

Blend all ingredients in a small food processor or blender until smooth.

Filling:
8 chicken drumsticks (or a mix of thigh and drumsticks)
2 tbsp fish sauce
2 tsp tamarind paste (or juice of a lime)
1 tsp tumeric
1 tsp brown sugar replacement
large handful of beansprouts
400ml coconut milk
1 red pepper cut into strips
dried rice noodles for 4

Skin the chicken; take the skin, salt it and lay on a rack in a baking tray. Preheat oven to 180C/350F. Put chicken skin in oven for 45 min. Warm a large, heavy based pan on medium heat and gently fry the paste for 1-2 min. Add coconut milk, water, chicken, fish sauce, tamarind, tumeric, and brown sugar. Bring to a boil, then reduce heat and allow to simmer for 30 min, stirring occasionally. Once chicken is cooked through and the sauce has thickened, add the beansprouts and red pepper. Cook for 2 min more. Follow the instructions on the package for rice noodles and cook them. Divide the noodles between 4 bowls and ladle in laksa.

Topping:
green tops of 4 spring onions
small handful of coriander and mint leaves, roughly chopped
1 lime, cut into wedges

Top each bowl with a piece of chicken skin, some spring onions, coriander, mint leaves, and wedges of lime.
