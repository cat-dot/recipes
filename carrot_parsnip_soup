Roasted Carrot and Parsnip Soup

2 lbs carrots
1 1/2 lbs parsnips
4 garlic cloves, thinly sliced
1 small yellow onion, thinly sliced
2" piece ginger, peeled and minced
1/4 c olive oil
kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper to taste
vegetable oil, for frying
1/4 c sage leaves
6 c chicken stock, divided
1/2 c heavy cream, divided

Preheat oven to 450F and line a baking sheet with parchment paper. Peel the carrots and parsnips, reserving the peels, and cut into 1/2" pieces. Transfer to a large bowl with the garlic, onion, and ginger. Add the olive oil, salt, and pepper, then toss to coat. Transfer to the prepared baking sheet in a single layer and roast, tossing halfway through, until tender and lightly caramelized, 30 min. Meanwhile, in a medium saucepan, heat 2" of oil to 350F and line a plate with paper towels. Working in batches, fry the reserved peels and sage leages until golden, 10-15 s, then transfer to the prepated plate to drain. Season with salt and set aside. Working in 2 batches, transfer half of the roasted vegetables to a blender with half the stock and cream. Puree until smooth, then transfer to a medium saucepan. Repeat with remaining vegetables, stock, and cream, then check for season and keep warm. Serve, garnishing with the fried peels & sage.
