  --America's Test Kitchen

1 1/2 lb russet potatoes, peeled
2 tbsp vegetable oil
salt and pepper

Cut potatoes lengthwise into 1/2" thick planks. Stack 3-4 planks and cut into 1/2" thick sticks; repeat with remaining planks. Submerge potatoes in large bowl of water and rinse to remove excess starch. Drain potatoes and repeat process as needed until water remains clear. Cover potatoes with hot tap water and let sit for 10 min. Drain potatoes, transfer to paper-towel lined rimmed baking sheet, and thoroughly pat dry. Toss potatoes with 1 tbsp oil in clean, dry bowl, then transfer to air fryer basket. Place in air fryer, set temp to 350F, and cook for 8 min. Transfer potatoes to same bowl and gently toss to redistribute. Return potatoes to air fryer and cook until softened and potatoes have turned from white to blond, 5-10 min. Transfer potatoes to same bowl and toss with remaining 1 tbsp oil and 1/2 tsp salt. Return to fryer, increase temp to 400F, and cook until golden brown and crisp, 15-20 min, tossing gently in bowl to redistribute every 5 min. Transfer fries to large plate and season with salt and pepper to taste. Serve immediately.
