Almon Sesame Soba Zoodles with Quick Pickled Veggies
  - Phoebe Lapine

8 oz buckwheat soba noodles
1 bunch of radishes (about 6 medium), cut into ½" cubes
1 lb cucumber, cut into ½" cubes
¼ c rice vinegar
2 tsp sea salt, divided
½ c unsalted almond butter
1 small garlic clove
¼ c freshly squeezed lime juice (from 2 limes)
2 tbsp gluten-free tamari
2 tsp raw honey
2 tsp dark toasted sesame oil
2 large zucchini (about 1 lb), spiralized into thin noodles
1 tbsp black sesame seeds, for garnish

Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil. Cook the soba noodles according to package directions until al dente. Drain and rinse with cool water until room temperature, shaking out all the excess. Transfer to a large mixing bowl and set aside. While the noodles are cooking, in a medium mixing bowl, combine the radishes, cucumber, vinegar, and 1 tsp salt. Allow veggies to marinate for 10 min, tossing occasionally. In the bowl of a small food processor, puree the almond butter, garlic, lime juice, tamari, honey, sesame oil, 1 tsp salt, and ¼ c water. Add more water, 1 tbsp at a time, until you reach the consistency of peanut sauce. Transfer to the mixing bowl with the soba noodles. Add the zucchini and toss until everything is well coated. Divide among serving bowls, top with the quick pickled veggies, and garnish with the sesame seeds.

Can be served room temp or cold.
