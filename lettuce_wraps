Chang's chicken lettuce wraps

1 pound chicken
3 tablespoons fresh ginger, minced
1 tablespoon garlic, minced
1/2 teaspoon dry chili flakes
3 tablespoons soybean oil or vegetable oil, divided
2 heads romaine lettuce
1/2 cup fresh orange juice
1 tablespoon fresh lime juice
1 tablespoon fresh lemon juice
1/4 cup soy sauce, divided
1 tablespoon hoisin sauce
1 ounce scallions, sliced thin
2 tablespoons soy sauce 
Dice the chicken into tiny pieces. Place the chicken in a mixing bowl and add 2 tablespoons soybean oil or vegetable oil, ginger, garlic, chili flakes and 2 tablespoons soy sauce. Mix together in a circular motion until well mixed. Let marinate in refrigerator for 2 to 4 hours.

Mix together the citrus juices, remaining soy, and hoisin sauce with a whisk. Reserve until needed.

Clean the romaine lettuce, chopping off the stem, peeling each "spear" and running under clean cold water. Reserve in refrigerator until ready to use. Chop scallions into rings and reserve chilled.

Coat a very hot saute pan lightly with soybean oil. Lay the chicken around the saute pan, being careful not to lay pieces on top of each other. Sear until the chicken until crispy and golden brown, about 2 1/2 minutes. Once chicken is brown, toss gently in pan and sear another 2 1/2 minutes. (The pan may appear to “burn,” but that is the caramelization and where all the flavor comes from.) 

Add 1/2 of the citrus-soy mixture to the saute pan and continue to cook, stirring, until sauce thickens into a glaze and coats the chicken. (Add additional sauce if you prefer a wetter mixture.)

Spoon chicken onto a plate and serve with the romaine spears. 

Wrap bite-size amounts of the chicken mixture in romaine lettuce and top with scallion rings. Serve and enjoy!

Chef's note: This recipe can also be made with baby shrimp, fish or beef.
