Orange Sherbet
  --Alton Brown

7 oz sugar
1 1/2 tbsp finely grated orange zest
1/4 tsp kosher salt
2 c freshly squeezed oj (2-3 lbs oranges)
1 tbsp freshly squeezed lemon juice
1 tsp vanilla
1 1/2 c very cold milk

In the bowl of a food processor combine all of the ingredients except the milk and process until the sugar is dissolved, ~1 min. Transfer the mixture to a mixing bowl and whisk in the milk. Cover the bowl and place in the refrigerator until the mixture reaches 40F or below, ~1 hour. Pour the mixture into an ice cream maker and process until it is the consistency of soft serve ice cream. You may serve now or transfer to a lidded container and place in freezer until firm, ~3 hrs.
