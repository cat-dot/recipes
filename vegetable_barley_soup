Farmhouse Vegetable Barley Soup
  --Cook's Illustrated

1/8 oz dried porcini mushrooms
8 sprigs fresh parsley + 3 tbsp chopped
4 sprigs fresh thyme
1 bay leaf
2 tbsp unsalted butter
1 1/2 lb leeks, white and light green parts sliced 1/2" thick and washed thoroughly
2 carrots, peeled and cut into 1/2" pieces
2 celery ribs, cut into 1/4" pieces
1/3 c dry white wine (sauvignon blanc)
2 tsp shoyu
salt and pepper
6 c water
4 c low-sodium chicken broth or vegetable broth
1/2 c pearl barley
1 garlic clove, peeled and smashed
1 1/2 lb Yukon Gold potatoes, peeled and cut into 1/2-inch pieces
1 turnip, peeled and cut into 3/4" pieces
1 1/2 c chopped green cabbage
1 c frozen peas
1 tsp lemon juice

Grind porcini with spice grinder until they resemble fine meal, 10-30 s. Measure out 2 tsp porcini powder; reserve remainder for other use. Using kitchen twine, tie together parsley sprigs, thyme, and bay leaf. Melt butter in large Dutch oven over medium heat. Add leeks, carrots, celery, wine, soy sauce, and 2 tsp salt. Cook, stirring occasionally, until liquid has evaporated and celery is softened, ~10 min. Add water, broth, barley, porcini powder, herb bundle, and garlic; increase heat to high and bring to boil. Reduce heat to medium-low and simmer, partially covered, for 25 min. Add potatoes, turnip, and cabbage; return to simmer and cook until barley, potatoes, turnip, and cabbage are tender, 18-20 min. Remove pot from heat and remove herb bundle. Stir in peas, lemon juice, and chopped parsley; season with salt and pepper to taste. Serve.


Notes: can also be garnished with crisp bacon, crumbled cheddar cheese, or croutons.
