Sweet Potato Brownies (gf)

#1 MFP
1 medium sweet potato
2 eggs
1/2 c almond butter
1/2 tsp vanilla extract
1/3 c almond meal (finely ground almonds)
1/3 c unsweetened cocoa powder
1/4 tsp baking soda
1/8 tsp salt
1/4 c cacao nibs, mini chocolate chips or chopped nuts (optional)

Preheat oven to 425°F. Wrap the sweet potato in foil and roast until tender, about 30 min. Let cool; peel and mash. Yields 1 c. Reduce oven to 350°F.  In a medium bowl, whisk eggs. Add sweet potato, almond butter and vanilla. Stir to combine. Add almond meal, cocoa powder, baking soda and salt. Stir until just combined. Coat an 8x8" baking pan with cooking spray. Dump batter into the pan; it will be thick, so use a spatula to spread it evenly. Sprinkle with cacao nibs, chocolate chips or nuts, if you like. Bake until set and starting to pull away from the edges, 20–25 min. Let cool at least 10 min before cutting into 16 pieces.
