Apple Cider Donuts
  --Betty Gold

4 1/4 c ap flour, plus more for work surface
1 c apple cider
1/4 c whole milk
1/3 c lightly packed dark brown sugar
2 large eggs
1 1/3 c sugar, divided
4 tbsp cold unsalted butter, cut into small pieces
1 tsp baking powder
1 tsp kosher salt
1/2tsp baking soda
1/2 tsp ground nutmeg
4 tsp cinnamon, divided
canola oil for frying

Line a baking sheet with parchment paper and dust generously with flour. Whisk apple cider, milk, brown sugar, eggs, and 1/3 c sugar in a large bowl until combined. In a food processor, pulse butter, baking powder, salt, baking soda, nutmeg, flour, and 2 tsp cinnamon until sandy. Mix the wet ingredients into the dry ingredients with a wooden spoon until just combined (dough will be very sticky) and then, with floured hands, transfer dough to the prepared baking sheet. Gently pat dough into a 1/2" thick rectangle, dust with more flour, and then refrigerate for 1 hr. (This makes the dough easier to work with.) Meanwhile, combine the remaining 1 c sugar and 2 tsp cinnamon, and then divide the mixture between two wide shallow bowls or pie plates. (The mixture clumps after a couple batches of hot donuts, so the this prevents that.) Fill a medium heavy-bottomed pot with 2" of oil and fit with a deep-fry or candy thermometer; and set over medium heat. Cut out donuts using a 3" donut cutter. Gather scraps, gently pat out again, and repeat until all the dough is used. When the thermometer reaches 360F, add donuts to the oil, working in batches, being careful not to overcrowd the pot. Fry, turning once until donuts are puffy and deep golden brown, ~2 min per side. Using tongs or a slotted spoon, transfer donuts to the cinnamon-sugar mixture and toss to coat. Repeat with remaining donuts, holes, and cinnamon-sugar mixture.
