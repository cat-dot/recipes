Mushroom Stew
  --Carolina Gelen
  
1 1/2 lb mixed mushrooms (like oyster, cremini, shiitake, portobello, chanterelle, etc.), very roughly chopped (if using shiitake or portobello, remove stems)
1/2 c evoo, divided
3 shallots, finely chopped
1 carrot, finely chopped
1/2 tbsp tomato paste
5 garlic cloves, minced
2 tbsp ap flour
1 c red wine
4 c vegetable, mushroom, chicken, or beef stock
2 tbsp shoyu
1/2 tsp smoked paprika
1 tsp hot or sweet paprika, depending on your preference
2 tsp coriander
1 tsp balsamic vinegar
kosher salt, to taste
fresh parsley, roughly chopped, for serving (or cilantro)
rice, couscous, mashed potatoes, etc., for serving

Cook the mushrooms: Set 3 qt casserole or a large Dutch oven over medium-high heat. Drizzle 1/4 c evoo in the pan and add a couple handfuls of mushrooms. Be careful not to overcrowd the pan, and try not to move them around too much as they cook; you also don’t need to salt them. Once the mushrooms are golden-brown, set them aside in a bowl. Working in batches, repeat until all the mushrooms are cooked. Add 1/4 c evool to the empty pan and lower the heat to medium. Cook the shallots and carrot until soft (the shallots should be translucent), for ~5 min, stirring occasionally. Add the garlic to the pan and cook for 2-3 min, until fragrant. Add the tomato paste and stir to combine, cooking for 3-4 min. Mix in the flour, stirring to coat the vegetables and aromatics in the pan, and cook for ~2 min. Then add in the cooked mushrooms, along with all the remaining ingredients up to the balsamic vinegar. Bring the mixture up to a boil on medium-high heat, then lower to a simmer and cook for 50-60 min. The mushroom stew should thicken and darken in color. Season to taste with kosher salt and garnish with fresh parsley, if you’d like. Serve warm over rice, couscous, mashed potatoes, etc.
