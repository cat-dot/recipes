Korean Pickles

1 lb kirby cucumbers, halved lengthwise and cute into 1/4" half moons
1 tbsp rice wine vinegar
1 tbsp goshugaru
1 tbsp granulated sugar
2 tsp kosher salt
1 tsp sesame oil
1 garlic clove, smashed

Place all of the ingredients in a sterilized quart jar. Shake to coat evenly. Then refrigerate for at least 2 hrs, shaking every 30 min, until enough liquid releases from the cucumbers to make a brine. Serve immediately or refrigerate for up to 3 days.
