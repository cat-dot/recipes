Sweet Potato Chaat

Potatoes:
16 medium (2 lbs) fingerling sweet potatoes
kosher salt to taste
5 tbsp tamarind chutney
1/2 tbsp fresh lime juice
1.2 tsp cayenne pepper
1 pinch chaat masala
granluated sugar to taste

Preheat oven to 325F. Season the potatoes with salt and wrap in foil. Place on a baking sheet and roast until tender, 45 min to 1 hr. Once the potatoes are cool enough to handle, peel and cut into 1/4" rounds.

Mint Chutney:
1/2 c mint leaves
1/2 c cilantro leaves
1/2 c whole plain yogurt
1 tbsp lime juice
1 tbsp minced shallot
1 tsp granulated sugar
1 serrano chile, minced and divided
kosher salt to taste
1/2 c red onion
1/4 c peanuts, toasted and roughly chopped
1/4 c cilantro, shredded
1/2 tsp ginger, minced
1 pinch chaat masala

In a blender, combine the mint, cilantro, yogurt, lime juice, shallot, sugar, half of serrano, and salt. Puree until smooth and transfer to a medium bowl. Stir in the remaining serrano and the rest of the chutney ingredients to incorporate, then set aside.

In a large bowl, combine the roasted sweet potatoes with the remaining ingredients and toss to coat. Transfer to a platter and spoon the mint chutney over top. Garnish with sev and pomegranate sees, then serve.

Chutney and potatoes can be made in advance, just need to reheat potatoes before serving.
