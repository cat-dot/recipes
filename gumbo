Seafood and Sausage Gumbo

1 c canola oil
1 c ap flour
10 c shrimp stock
14 1/2 oz can diced tomatoes, drained
1 tbsp cajun seasoning
2 tsp dried basil
1 tsp onion powder
1/2 tsp cayenne pepper
20 garlic cloves, roughly chopped
4 celery stalks, diced
2 bay leaves
2 medium bell peppers, diced
1 large onion, diced
2 lbs head-on medium shrimp
1 lb crawfish tails
8 oz crab claw meat
8 oz shucked oysters
8 oz (3 links) smoked andouille sasage, sliced into 1/3" coins
8 oz okra, sliced into 1" pieces

In a large dutch oven, heat the oil over medium heat. Once the oil is hot, whisk in the flour to form a roux. Cook the roux, stirring constantly, until almost black in color, 50-55 min. Slowly pour in the stock, while constantly stirring until the stock is fully incorporated. Add the tomatoes, cajun seasoning, basil, onion powder, cayenne, garlic, celery, bay leaves, peppers, and onion. Bring to a simmer, then cook, stirring occasionally, until thickened, 1 hr. Add the remaining ingredients and simmer until the seafood is cooked and the okra is tender, 10-12 min. Ladle into bowls and serve with a scoop of rice on top.
