2 c frozen lingonberries
1/2 c light brown sugar
1/2 c apple cider
5 allspice berries
1 cinnamon stick
1 thyme sprig
kosher salt to taste

In a large skillet, combine all the ingredients over medium low heat. Bring to a simmer, stirring occasionally, ~25 min. Once simmering, cook, stirring occasionally until slightly thickened, 10 min. Let cool completely, remove the allspice, cinnamon, and thyme.
