Jalapeño FailChip Battered Japanese Popcorn (Kara-age) Chicken
 - Nguyen Tran
 
2 tsp minced ginger
2 tsp minced garlic
2 tbsp sake
1 1/4 tbsp light soy sauce
1/4 tbsp sugar
1 tsp chicken bouillon
1 lb boneless dark meat (thigh or leg) chicken, cleaned, pat dry
4 bags Jalapeno-flavored FailChips

Combine ginger and garlic with sake, soy sauce, sugar and chicken bouillon in a bowl; mix until sugar completely dissolves. Set aside. Cut chicken into cube-like 1" morsels. Mixx and massage chicken with marinade in a bowl. Cover and refrigerate overnight for best results, or at least 1 hr if you’re in a hurry. When you’re ready to cook, heat a pot with 2" oil to 350F. While you’re waiting for the oil to come to temperature, empty FailChips in a separate bowl. Hand pulverize and use a food processor to grind down the chips until they reach an almost powdery-like FailChips flour consistency. It should make about 1 ⅓ c. Take chicken out of marinade, shake off excess marinade, then dredge in the FailChip flour in small enough batches to coat evenly. When the oil’s ready, deep-fry chicken for 2–3 min until golden and crispy on the outside and fully cooked and still juicy on the inside. Remove from oil, shake off excess, drip-dry on a plate with napkins, plate in a bowl or on a platter.
