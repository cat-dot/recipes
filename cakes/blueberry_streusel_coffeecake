1 large egg
1 tsp vanilla 
1/2 c milk
2 c fresh or frozen blueberries

Preheat the oven to 375F. Lightly grease a 9" round cake pan. If you use a round pan, make sure itâ€™s at least 2" deep. Blend the flour, baking powder, and salt together in a medium-sized mixing bowl. In a separate bowl, beat together the sugar, butter, egg, and vanilla. Alternately add the milk and the flour mixture to the sugar/butter mixture, ending with flour. Add blueberries. Stir only enough to blend. Pour the batter into the prepared pan. Sprinkle the topping over the batter. Bake the cake for 40-45 min, or until a toothpick or knife inserted into the center comes out clean. Remove the cake from the oven, and set it on a rack to cool for 10 min. Serve right from the pan. Or, to transfer to a serving plate, loosen the sides with a knife or spatula. Holding the pan in your left hand, gently tip the cake out onto your right hand, remove the pan, and gently right the cake onto a serving dish.
