Summer Strawberry Cake
  --Smitten Kitchen, adapted from Martha Stewart

6 tbsp (85 g) unsalted butter, at room temperature, plus extra for pie plate
1 1/2 c (188 g) ap flour (can swap 3/4 c or 94 g ap flour with 3/4 c or 75 g of barley flour)
1 1/2 tsp baking powder
1/2 tsp table salt
1 c (200 g) + 2 tbsp (25 g) sugar
1 large egg
1/2 c (118 ml) milk
1 tsp (5 ml) vanilla extract
1 lb (450 g) strawberries, hulled and halved

Preheat oven to 350F (180C). Butter a 10" pie pan or 9-10" springform. Whisk flour or flours, baking powder and salt together in a small bowl. In a larger bowl, beat butter and 1 c sugar until pale and fluffy with an electric mixer, ~3 min. Mix in egg, milk and vanilla until just combined. Add dry mixture gradually, mixing until just smooth. Pour into prepared pan. Arrange strawberries, cut side down, on top of batter, as closely as possible in a single layer (though I had to overlap a few to get them all in). Sprinkle remaining 2 tbsp sugar over berries. Bake cake for 10 min then reduce oven temperature to 325F and bake cake until golden brown and a tester comes out free of wet batter, ~50-60 min. (Gooey strawberries on the tester are a given.) Let cool in pan on a rack. Cut into wedges. Serve with lightly whipped cream. Cake can be stored at room temperature for up to 2 days, loosely covered.
