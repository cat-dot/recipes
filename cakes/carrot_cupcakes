Carrot Cupcakes with Cream Ceese Frosting

Cupcakes:
3 large eggs
2 c sugar
3/4 c oil
3/4 c buttermilk
2 tsp vanilla
2 c flour
2 tsp baking soda
1/2 tsp salt
2 tsp cinnamon
3/4 lb carrots, greated (2 c)
1 c crushed pineapple, drained
1/2 c coconut flakes
1 c chopped pecans

Preheat oven to 350F. In a mixing bowl, whisk eggs and sugar until well combined. Add oil, buttermilk, and vanilla and combine well. Add flour, baking soda, cinnamon, and salt. Mix until smooth. Add grated carrot, pineapple, coconut, and pecans to the bowl and mix. The mixture is a little soupy. Line the cupcake pan with liners. Gently pour enough batter into each liner to fill 3/4 full. Bake for 20-25 min or until a toothpick inserted in the center comes out clean. 

Glaze:
1/2 c sugar
3/4 tsp baking soda
1/4 c buttermilk
1/4 c butter
1/2 tsp vanilla

Heat sugar, baking soda, buttermilk, and butter in a saucepan over medium heat until it is smooth and a little frothy, ~5 min. Remove from heat and stir in vanilla. Set aside.

Frosting:
1/2 c cream cheese at room temp
1/2 c butter, softened
2 c powdered sugar
1 tsp vanilla

With an electric mixer, cream butter and cream cheese. Add powdered sugar 1 c at a time. Add vanilla and beat until light and airy.

When the cupcakes are finished baking, remove from the oven. Leave them in the tin and pour 1 tbsp glaze on top of each. Let cool completely and remove from pan. Spoon frosting into a resealable sandwich bag. Press all the aire out of the bag, seal, and snip off ~1/2" off one of the bottom corners. Use bag to pipe frosting onto each cupcake. Refill the bag as necessary.
