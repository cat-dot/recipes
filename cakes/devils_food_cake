Devil's Food Cake

3/4 lb (3 sticks) unsalted butter at room temp
2 1/4 c sugar
4 extra large eggs at room temp
4 tsp vanilla
3/4 c unsweetened cocoa powder
3/4 c hot brewed coffee or espresso
3 c ap flour
1 tsp baking soda
1 tsp baking powder
1 1/2 tsp kosher salt
1 c sour cream

Preheat oven to 350F. Grease 2 9x2" round cake pans, line with parchment paper, grease and flour the pans. Set aside. In the bowl of an electric mixer fitted with the paddle attachment, cream the butter and sugar on medium speed for 3 min, until light and fluffy. On low speed, add the eggs, one at a time. Add the vanilla and beat until well mixed, scraping down the bowl with a rubber spatula. Whisk the cocoa powder and hot coffee together in a small bowl. With the mixer on low, add it into the batter. In a medium bowl, sift together the flour, baking soda, baking powder, and salt. With the mixer on low, slowly add 1/2 the flour mixture to the batter, then all the sour cream, then the remaining flour mixture, mixing each addition until combined. With a rubber spatula, fold the batter until it is well mixed. Divide the batter equally between the prepared pans and smooth the tops. Bake for 30-35 min, until a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean. Cool in the pans for 30 min, turn out onto a baking rack and cool completely.
