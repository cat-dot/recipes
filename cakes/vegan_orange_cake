Vegan Orange Cake
  --Stephanie - allrecipes.com
  
1 large orange, peeled (1 c oj
1 1/2 c ap flour
1 c sugar
1/2 c vegetable oil
1 1/2 tsp baking soda
1/2 tsp salt

Preheat oven to 375F/190C; grease a 8x8" baking dish. Blend orange in blender, take 1 c juice for cake. Whisk all ingredients in a bowl until fully incorporated. Pour into prepared pan and bake until tester inserted into middle comes out clean ~30 min.


Notes: For plain cake, can sub any milk (obv cow milk makes non-vegan). Can just use oj instead of blending an orange. 
I cooked ~2 c of pureed orange to strengthen flavor, still is a tad light on orange flavor. Probably should add zest if you want more orange flavor. Also found that it works best to combine all wet ingredients, adding dry in 2 batches. Switched leavening to 1 tsp baking soda and 1/2 tsp baking powder. Cake turned out very moist and dense, others have suggested adding 2-3 tbsp more flour as batter was a tad loose.
