Graham Coconut Cake
  --Hannah Dennehy O'Neill

Lemon Filling:
6 tbsp sugar
2 tbsp lemon juice
1/4 c sour cream
2 tbsp butter

In small saucepan, beat sugar and sour cream. Add juice and butter. Cook over medium high heat until it boils 3 min. Let stand until thick. After spreading on cake, let stand a few min to set before putting the next layer on top.


White Icing:
3 or 4 tbsp butter
pinch salt
2 egg whites
powdered sugar

beat butter, salt, whites, and ~ 3/4 c powdered sugar until well mixed. Gradually beat in enough powdered sugar to make it right for spreading in a thin layer.


Cake:
10 tbsp butter
pinch salt
4 eggs
11 oz (3 c) graham cracker crumbs
1 1/3 c sugar
1 1/2 tsp baking powder
1 1/3 c milk
5 oz (1 1/s c packed) shredded coconut

Grease 2x9" round pans, line bottoms with paper. Cream butter, sugar, salt, and baking powder. Add eggs one at a time, beating each in well. Alternately add crumbs and milk. (It will look unpromising) Stir in coconut. Bake ~30 min. Put lemon filling in the middle and a thin layer of white icing on top and sides.
