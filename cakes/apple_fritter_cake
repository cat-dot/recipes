Apple Fritter Cake
  --Susan Reid

Topping:
2 tbsp (28g) unsalted butter
1 1/2 tsp cinnamon
1/4 tsp salt
3 1/2 c (396g) apples, diced in 1/2" pieces (from ~4 medium apples)*
1/2 c (107g) light brown sugar, packed

In a large skillet, melt the butter over medium-high heat. Add the cinnamon and salt and stir to combine.  Add the apples to the skillet and stir to coat in the butter mixture. Cook for ~5 min, stirring occasionally, until the apples just begin to soften. Sprinkle the sugar evenly over the apples and stir to combine. Cook, stirring occasionally, for ~5 min. Initially, the apples will release a lot of liquid; continue to cook until most of the liquid has evaporated. Remove from the heat once the mixture has become just slightly sticky. (The apples will not be fully tender.) Allow the apple mixture to cool in the pan, off the heat, while you prepare the cake batter.

Cake:
2 1/4 c (270g) ap flour
2 1/2 tsp baking powder
1 c (198g) granulated sugar
1 tsp table salt
1/4 tsp nutmeg or allspice
12 tbsp (170g) unsalted butter, at room temperature
3 large eggs, at room temperature 
2 tsp vanilla 
3/4 c (170g) milk, at room temperature

Preheat the oven to 350F. Line a 9" square pan with a parchment sling and lightly grease. In a large bowl (or the bowl of a stand mixer), combine the flour, baking powder, sugar, salt, and spice. Add the butter and mix until the mixture looks sandy. With the mixer running on low speed, beat in the eggs one at a time until fully incorporated, scraping the bowl between additions as needed. With the mixer running at low speed, add the vanilla and milk. Once the milk is absorbed, scrape the bowl and mix at medium-high speed for 1 min. Transfer the batter to the prepared pan and spread it into an even layer. Spoon the apple topping evenly over the batter. Bake the cake for 60-65 min or until a paring knife inserted in the center comes out clean. Remove the cake from the oven and cool for 30 min before gently tipping it out of the pan onto a rack to cool completely.

Glaze:
3/4 c (85g) confectioners' sugar, sifted 
1 1/2 - 3 tbsp (21g to 43g) milk, whole preferred
1/2 tsp vanilla

In a small bowl, combine the glaze ingredients, starting with 1 1/2 tbsp (21g) of the milk; whisk until smooth. Add additional milk, if necessary, to achieve a thinner, more fritter-like glaze. Drizzle over the cooled cake. Allow the glaze to set briefly before slicing and serving.


Notes: use pink lady or granny smith apples
