1 c heavy cream
1 c sugar
1/4 tsp salt
1 tsp vanilla
8 tbsp (1 stick) unsalted butter, softened
1 recipe yellow layer cake (enough to makre 2x8" layers; ~5 1/3 c batter)

Place chocolate in large bowl. Heat cream, sugar, and salt in saupcepan over medium low heat, stirring occasionally, until sugar dissolves and mixture begins to simmer. Pour hot cream mixture over chocolate and whisk until smooth. Whisk in vanilla and butter until glossy. Cover and refrigerate until icing is firm but still spreadable, ~1 hr. Adjust oven rack to middle position and heat oven to 350F. Generously grease and flour 2x8" (or 9") cake pans and line with parchment paper. Spread 1/8 of batter (~2/3 c) evenly in each pan and bake until edges are golden brown and cake springs back when touched, 10-14 min. Cool on rack 5 min. Run knife around pan perimeter to loosen cake, then invert onto rack to finish cooling. Cool pans to room temp, then wipe clean and repeat process 3 more times for a total of 8 layers. Place 1 cooled layer on platter. Spread 1/4 c frosting over cake, if frosting is too firm, let warm at room temp for 5 min, then stir to soften. Top with second layer and additional 1/4 c frosting. Repeat, alternating cake with frosting and finishing with cake layer. Frost top and sides with remaining frosting. Serve.
