Cake:
nonstick cooking spray
2 c ap flour
2 1/2 tsp chinese five-spice
1 1/2 tsp ground cinnamon
1/2 tsp freshyly grated nutmeg
2 tsp baking powder
1/4 tsp baking soda
1 c dry hard cider, opened so it loses its fizz
3/4 c vegetable oil
1/2 c dark brown sugar
1 c molasses
3 large eggs
1 1/4" piece fresh ginger, peeled and finely grated (2 tsp)

Preheat the oven to 325F. Grease a bundt cake pan with nonstick spray and place on a baking sheet. In a medium bowl, whisk together the flour, five-spice, cinnamon, nutmeg, baking powder, and baking soda; set aside. In a large bowl, whisk together the cider, oil, brown sugar, eggs, molasses, and fresh ginger, stirring until smooth. In 2 additions, whisk the flour mix into the cider mix, stirring after each addition just until smooth. Pour the batter into the prepared baking pan and bake until the sides of the cake start to come away from the sides of the pan and a cake tester inserted into the middle of the cake comes out clean, 40-50 min.


Caramel Sauce:
1/2 c + 2 tbsp unsalted butter
1/2 c light brown sugar
1/2 c sugar
1/3 c golden or light corn syrup
1 c heavy cream
4 tsp smoked sea salt

In a small, heavy bottomed saucepan, combine the butter, sugars, and syrup, and bring to a simmer over medium high heat. Cook for 3 min, swirling the pan every now and then. Add the cream and salt, and swirl again, then give it a stir with a wooden spoon and cook 1 min more. The sauce makes 2 c and can be stored in the refrigerator for up to 1 week or freezer for up to 3 months. To reheat, let it come to room temp before gently warming in a saucepan. 

When the cake is done, transfer to a wire rack and let cool 30 min. Loosen the edges of the cake and invert onto the rack. Let it cool completely, then pour the caramel sauce over just before serving.
