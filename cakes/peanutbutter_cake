3 Ingredient Flourless Peanut Butter Cake

4 large eggs
6 oz creamy peanut butter (by weight, not fluid oz measurement)
3/4 c sugar

Grease & flour or line with parchment a 7" round springform pan. Preheat oven to 350F. Beat eggs on highest speed with stand mixer using the whisk attachment, until triple in volume, about 8 minutes. Make sure you beat the eggs long enough. This cake depends on the eggs. The egg batter should turn a very pale yellow and become quite thick. Add in sugar and beat for another 2 minutes. Measure out peanut butter into a large mixing bowl. Add in 1/3 of the egg mixture. Gently stir and fold with a spatula in the same clockwise direction until all of the egg is mixed in and no streaks remain. Make sure you are stirring by hand gently with a spatula. Do not use a whisk and do not use a mixer, otherwise you will deflate the eggs too much.Then add another 1/3 of egg mixture and stir again until no egg streaks remain. Scrape a few times from the bottom of your bowl to make sure there is no peanut butter that may have sunk to the bottom. Pour in remaining third and make sure to scrape the egg foam that sticks to the mixing bowl into your batter and stir until no streaks remain. Pour batter into springform pan. Bake for 30-35min until knife inserted in the middle comes out clean. Let cool before cutting and serving. Cake will initially be puffy and will deflate as it cools
