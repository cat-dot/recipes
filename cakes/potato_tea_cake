Purple Sweet Potato and Cranberry Tea Cakes

1 medium (8oz) purple sweet potato
1 medium (8oz) white yam
2 tbsp dried cranberries, minced
1 tbsp vegetable oil
1 tbsp granulated sugar
1/4 tsp salt

In a medium saucepan fitted with a steamer basket, add enough water to come up just below the basket and bring to a simmer over medium heat. Place the sweet potato and yam in the basket and steam, covered, until tender when pierced with a knife, 30 min. Transfer potatoes to a cutting board until cool enough to handle, then peel and press through a ricer. Heat a medium saucepan over medium heat and add the riced potato and yam. Cook until dried slightly and the mixture has formed a single mass, 5-6 min. Stir in the remaining ingredients to incorporate. Line 6x4oz ramekins with plastic wrap and press 1/4 c of the mixture into each, smoothing the tops flat. Let cool completely. Use the plastic wrap to remove each cake from the ramekin and cut into wedges, then serve.
