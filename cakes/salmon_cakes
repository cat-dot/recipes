Salmon Cakes
  --Natasha's Kitchen (Natasha Kravchuk)
  
1 lb fresh salmon filet*
garlic salt
black pepper
olive oil
1 medium onion (1 c finely diced)
1/2 red bell pepper, diced
3 tbsp unsalted butter, divided
1 c panko bread crumbs
2 large eggs, lightly beaten
3 tbsp mayo
1 tsp worcestershire sauce
1/4 c minced fresh parsley

reheat Oven to 425F. Line a rimmed baking sheet with parchment or a silpat. Place salmon skin-side down, brush with olive oil and season with garlic salt and black pepper. Bake uncovered for 10-15 min or just until cooked through. Remove from oven, cover with foil and rest ten minutes. Discard skin, flake salmon with forks, remove any bones, and cool to room temp while prepping remaining ingredients. Heat medium skillet over medium heat and add 1 tbsp oil and 1 tbsp butter. Add onion and bell pepper and saute until softened and golden, 7-9 min, then remove from heat. In a large mixing bowl, combine cooled flaked salmon, sautéed onion and pepper, panko, eggs, mayo, Worcestershire sauce, 1 tsp garlic salt, 1/4 tsp black pepper, and parsley. Stir to combine then form into 13-14 patties. I find it’s easiest to portion the patties using a flat ice cream scoop then pressing them into 1/3 to 1/2″ thick patties. Heat 1 tbsp oil and 1 tbsp butter in large skillet over medium heat and once butter is sizzling, add half the cakes. Saute 3-4 min per side or until golden and cooked through. If salmon cakes brown too quickly, reduce heat. Remove to a paper-towel lined plate. Add remaining butter and 1 tbsp oil and repeat with remaining cakes. 


Note: Fresh salmon is best, but it can be substituted with leftover cooked salmon, or 14-15 oz of well-drained canned salmon, or three 5 oz salmon packets. If mixture is too moist to hold the patty shape, add more bread crumbs and if it is too dry, add an extra tbsp of mayo. I found mixture very wet, ended up adding crushed Ritz crackers
