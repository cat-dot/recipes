1 tsp fresh grated lemon zest
1 c granulated white sugar
1/2 c unsalted butter (softened)
2 large eggs
1 c Greek yogurt
1/4 c cream
1 tablespoon lemon juice

Preheat oven to 350F. Butter and flour a square baking pan. Combine the lemon zest, sugar and butter in a mixer and mix until fluffy, ~3 min. Add the eggs and beat until incorporated, ~3 more min. Beat in the yogurt, cream and lemon juice. In a separate bowl, whisk together the flour, baking powder, baking soda and salt. Add to the yogurt mixture, stirring until just fully incorporated. Pour into prepared baking pan and smooth the top. Arrange the halved berries on top of the cake, cut-side down. Bake 30-35 min, or until a tester inserted in the center of the cake comes out clean. Serve sprinkled with powdered sugar, if desired.
