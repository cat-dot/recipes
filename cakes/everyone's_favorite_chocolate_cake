Everyone's Favorite Chocoate Cake
  --Leanne Brown

Cake:
1/2 c stout (such as Guinness)
1/2 c (1 stick) unsalted butter
3/4 c unsweetened cocoa powder
1 c ap flour
1 cup sugar
3/4 tsp baking soda
1/2 tsp salt
1 large egg
1/3 c sour cream

Preheat oven to 350F. Line a 9" cake pan with parchment and butter the paper. Bring the butter and stout to a simmer in a saucepan over medium heat. Add the cocoa powder and whisk until mixture is smooth. Set aside to cool. Whisk the flour, sugar, baking soda, and salt in a medium bowl to blend. Set aside. In a large bowl whisk the egg and sour cream together then whisk in the cooled butter/stout/sour cream mixture. Pour in the flour mixture and gently stir with a spatula or spoon until just combined. Do not over mix. Pour the batter into the prepared pan. Bake for 25 min or until a knife inserted into the center comes out clean. Let cool completely before frosting.
 
Frosting:
1/2 lb strawberries
1/2 c unsalted butter, at room temperature
1 1/2 c powdered sugar
1 tsp vanilla 

Cut the strawberries then blend them in a blender until smooth. Pour them into a small pan and bring them to a simmer. Simmer them on medium heat until the strawberries have reduced and thickened, ~20 min. Let the mixture cool in the fridge (it will thicken up further). Using an electric mixer, whip the butter and powdered sugar on high until fluffy. Add in the boiled and cooled strawberries and vanilla and beat until fluffy. Frost the cake by gently spreading the frosting all over the top of the cake, then decorating with some cut strawberries.
