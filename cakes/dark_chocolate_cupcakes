Dark Chocolate Cupcakes
  --Cook's Illustrated

8 tbsp unsalted butter, cut into 4 pieces
2 oz bittersweet chocolate, chopped
1/2 c Dutch-processed cocoa (1 1/2 oz)
3/4 c unbleached ap flour (3 3/4 oz)
1/2 tsp baking soda
3/4 tsp baking powder
2 large eggs
3/4 c sugar (5 1/4 oz)
1 tsp vanilla 
1/2 c sour cream (4 oz)
1/2 tsp table salt

Adjust oven rack to lower-middle position; heat oven to 350F. Line standard-sized muffin pan (cups have 1/2 c capacity) with baking-cup liners. Combine butter, chocolate, and cocoa in medium heatproof bowl. Set bowl over saucepan containing barely simmering water; heat mixture until butter and chocolate are melted and whisk until smooth and combined. Set aside to cool until just warm to the touch. Whisk flour, baking soda, and baking powder in small bowl to combine. Whisk eggs in second medium bowl to combine; add sugar, vanilla, and salt and whisk until fully incorporated. Add cooled chocolate mixture and whisk until combined. Sift ~1/3 of flour mixture over chocolate mixture and whisk until combined; whisk in sour cream until combined, then sift remaining flour mixture over and whisk until batter is homogenous and thick. Divide batter evenly among muffin pan cups. Bake until skewer inserted into center of cupcakes comes out clean, 18-20 min. Cool cupcakes in muffin pan on wire rack until cool enough to handle, ~15 min. Carefully lift each cupcake from muffin pan and set on wire rack. Cool to room temperature before icing, about 30 minutes. (To frost: Mound ~2 tbsp icing on center of each cupcake. Using small icing spatula or butter knife, spread icing to edge of cupcake, leaving slight mound in center.)
