  --Lauren Schaefer

2 lemons (zest)
1 c  sugar
3 large eggs
1 3/4 c ap flour
1 1/2 tsp baking powder
1/2 tsp kosher salt
6 tbsp whole milk

Place rack in center of oven; preheat to 350F. Butter a 9x4" loaf pan, fully coating bottom and sides. Line pan lengthwise with parchment paper, leaving ~2" overhang. Zest 2 lemons into a large bowl. Add butter and and sugar. Using electric mixer on high, beat until mixture is very light and fluffy, ~5 min. Beat in eggs one at a time, waiting until each is incorporated before adding the next. Continue to beat until mixture is lighter and even fluffier, ~2 min. Whisk flour, baking powder, and salt in another large bowl. Add half the dry ingredients to the butter mixture and beat on low spead until just combined.Beat in milk on low until just smooth, then add remaining dry ingredients and beat until just combined, scraping down sides as needed. Pour (scrape) batter into prepared pan, smooth top with spatula. Bake, rotating once halfway through, until tester comes out clean, 45-55 min.

Glaze:
1 lemon
1/2 c lemon juice (use lemons from cake)
1 1/2 c powdered sugar

Remove zest of lemon with a vegetable peeler. Transfer to a cutting board and cut into thin strips; set aside. Place powdered sugar in another medium bowl. Slowly whisk in about half of the lemon juice until smooth, then add sliced zest; set aside.

Let cake cool ~10 min. Poke 10-15 holes evenly throughout the cake with a cake tester or toothpick. Pour the remaining lemon juice over the top of the cake. Let cool completely. Run a butter knife around edges of pan to loosen, using overhang lift cake onto a wire rack, discarding the parchment. Pour glaze over cake, letting it fall down the sides. Let sat for at least 10 min before slicing.
