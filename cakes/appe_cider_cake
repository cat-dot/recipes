Apple Cider Magic Cake

Reduction:
6 c apple cider

In a large saucepan, simmer the apple cider over medium heat until reduced to 3/4 c and the consistency of honey, 30-40 min. Set aside and let cool completely.

Batter:
4 large eggs, yolks and whites separated
1 c confectioners' sugar
1 tsp kosher salt
1/2 c apple cider reduction
1 tsp vanilla
8 tbsp unsalted butter, melted but cool
1 c ap flour
1 3/4 c milk

Preheat oven to 325F. In the bowl of a stand mixer, whip the egg whites to stiff peaks using whisk attachment, 5-8 min. Remove the whipped egg whites and set aside. In the same bowl, add the egg yolks and sugar, mix on medium speed until a light yellow color, 4-5 min. Add the salt, cooled apple cider reduction, and vanilla, and mix for 2 min at medium speed. Bring the mixer to low speed and stream in the melted butter until fully incorporated. Add the flour to the mixture and whisk on medium speed until it comes together. While on low speed, stream in the milk and whisk until the milk has fully emulsified with the butter and other ingredients. Fold in the whipped egg whites with a rubber spatula and pour the cake batter into a buttered cake pan 9" in diameter. Bake the cake until it no longer jiggles when gently shaken, 45-50 min. Allow the cake to cool, 1 hr.

Topping:
1/4 c creme fraiche
1/4 c heavy cream
1/4 c confectioners' sugar
1/4 tsp kosher salt
1/4 c apple cider reduction

In a clean bowl of stand mixer, add all of the ingredients except the reduction, and whip using a whisk attachment to medium stiff peaks. When the cake has fully cooled, spread the creme fraiche whip on top and drizzle with the reduction. Slice and serve at room temp.
