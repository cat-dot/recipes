  --America's Test Kitchen

Topping:
4 tbsp (1/2 stick) unsalted butter, cut into 4 pieces + extra for pan
4 granny smith or golden delicious apples (~2 lbs), peeled and cored
2/3 c packed light brown sugar (4 2/3 oz)
2 tsp juice from 1 lemon

Butter bottom and sides of 9" round, 2" deep nonstick cake pan; set aside. Adjust oven rack to lowest position and heat oven to 350F. Halve apples from pole to pole. Cut 2 apples into 1/4" thick slices; set aside. Cut remaining 2 apples into 1/2" thick slices. Heat butter in 12" skillet over medium high heat. When foaming subsides, add 1/2" thick apple slices and cook, stirring 2-3 times, until apples begin to caramelize, 4-6 min. Do not fully cook apples. Add 1/4" thick apple slices, brown sugar, and lemon juice; continue cooking, stirring constantly, until sugar dissolves and apples are coated, ~1 min longer. Transfer appl mixture to prepared pan and lightly press into even layer. Set aside while preparing cake.

1 c unbleached ap flour (5 oz)
1 tbsp cornmeal (optional)
1 tsp baking powder
1/2 tsp table salt

1/4 c packed light brown sugar (1 3/4 oz)
2 large eggs
6 tbsp (3/4 stick) unsalted butter, melted and cooled slightly
1/2 c sour cream
1 tsp vanilla

Whisk flour, cornmeal (if using), baking powder, and salt together in medium bowl; set aside. Whisk sugars and eggs together in large bowl until thick and homogeneous, ~45 s. Slowly whisk in butter until combined. Add sour cream and vanilla; whisk until combined. Add flour mixture and whisk until just combined. Pour batter into pan and spread evenly over fruit. Bake until cake is golden brown and toothpick inserted into center comes out clean, 35-40 min. Cool pan on wire rack 20 min. Run paring knife around sides of cake to loosen.
