Flourless Chocolate Cake
  --Cook's Country
  
12 oz bittersweet chocolate, broken into 1-inch pieces
16 tbsp unsalted butter
6 large eggs
1 c (7 oz) sugar
1/2 c water
1 tbsp cornstarch
1 tbsp vanilla extract
1 tsp instant espresso powder
1/2 tsp salt

Adjust oven rack to middle position and heat oven to 275F. Spray 9" springform pan with vegetable oil spray. Microwave chocolate and butter in bowl at 50% power, stirring occasionally with rubber spatula, until melted, ~4 min. Let chocolate mixture cool for 5 min. Whisk eggs, sugar, water, cornstarch, vanilla, espresso powder, and salt together in large bowl until thoroughly combined, ~30 s. Whisk in chocolate mixture until smooth and slightly thickened, ~45 s. Strain batter through fine-mesh strainer into prepared pan, pressing against strainer with rubber spatula or back of ladle to help batter pass through. Gently tap pan on counter to release air bubbles; then let sit on counter for 10 min to allow air bubbles to rise to top. Use tines of fork to gently pop any air bubbles that have risen to surface. Bake until edges are set and center jiggles slightly when cake is shaken gently, 45-50 min. Let cake cool for 5 min, then run paring knife between cake and sides of pan. Let cake cool in pan on wire rack until barely warm, ~30 min. Cover cake tightly with plastic wrap, poke small hole in top, and refrigerate until cold and firmly set, at least 6 hr. To unmold cake, remove sides of pan and slide thin metal spatula between cake bottom and pan bottom to loosen, then slide cake onto serving platter.
