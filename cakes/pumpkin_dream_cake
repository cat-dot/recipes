Pumpkin Dream Cake
  --Jessica Merchant

Cake:
2 c ap flour
2 tsp baking soda
1 1/4 tsp ground cinnamon
1/2 tsp salt
1/4 tsp freshly grated nutmeg
15 oz can pumpkin puree
1 3/4 c brown sugar
1/2 c plain greek yogurt
1/2 c vegetable oil
4 large eggs
2 tsp vanilla

Preheat the oven to 350 F. Spray a 9x13" baking dish with nonstick baking spray. In a bowl, whisk together the flour, baking soda, cinnamon, salt and nutmeg. Note: If you LOVE spice, feel free to add some extra spice in here (pumpkin! allspice! more cinnamon! - you can add another 1/2 - 1 tsp if you'd like) as this isn't overly spiced. In a large bowl, whisk together the pumpkin, sugar, yogurt, and oil. Once smooth and combined, whisk in each egg one at a time. Whisk in the vanilla. Add the dry ingredients to the wet, mixing until combined and no large lumps remain. Pour the batter into the greased baking dish. Bake for 30-40 min, or until a tester inserted in the center of the cake comes out clean. Cool the cake completely. Once the cake has cooled, frost with the cream cheese frosting.

Frosting:
2x8 oz blocks cream cheese
1/2 c unsalted butter
2 1/2 c powdered sugar
1/2 tsp cinnamon
1 tsp vanilla

Beat the cream cheese and butter together until creamy. Beat in the sugar and cinnamon until combined. Beat in the vanilla extract. Frost the cooled cake.


Notes: probably best to store frosted cake in refrigerator due to frosting
