Citrus Cake
 --Yasmin Khan
 
Cake:
1 c (225 g) softened unsalted butter + more for the pans
1 3/4 c (225 g) ap flour
1 c (200 g) granulated sugar
4 extra-large eggs, lightly beaten
3 1/2 tsp baking powder
3/4 tsp salt
1 tsp vanilla extract
1/4 c (55 g) full-fat plain yogurt
2 tbsp finely grated unwaxed orange zest
2 tbsp orange juice

Heat the oven to 350F (180°C). Butter 2x8" (20cm) round cake pans and line the bottoms with parchment paper. Place all the ingredients for the cake together in a large bowl and beat just until the streaks of flour disappear—an electric mixer will make quick work of it, or you can easily beat by hand, especially if the butter is quite soft. Divide the batter evenly between the prepared pans. Bake until lightly golden, 20-25 min. Let the cakes cool in the pans for 5 min, then transfer them to a wire rack.

Frosting:
2/3 c (80 g) confectioners’ sugar
12 oz (350 g) full-fat cream cheese at room temp
1/4 c (55 g) full-fat plain yogurt
1 tbsp orange juice
2 tbsp lemon juice
Orange and unwaxed lemon, to zest for garnish

Mix together the ingredients and beat until smooth. Place this in the refrigerator to chill and firm up while the cake cools.

When the cake is completely cool, use an offset spatula to spread half the frosting on one cake. Place the other on top and cover with the rest of the frosting. Finish by decorating with a scattering of orange and lemon zests 


Notes: Beat the eggs in the mixer first, then add all the other ingredients. Peel the citrus using for garnish with vegetable peeler and cut into match sticks (or use bar zester)
