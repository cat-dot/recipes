Molten Caramel Cake
  --Chris Morocco

Filling:
1/4 c store bought dulce de leche
1 tbsp unsalted butter, room temp

Stir dulce de leche and butter in small bowl until well combined. Dollop in 4 equal size blobs on metal baking sheet or dish (can line with silpat). Freeze at least 30 min or up to overnight until very firm.

Cake:
2/3 c ap flour
1 tsp kosher salt
1/4 tsp baking powder
6 tbsp unsalted butter + more for ramekins, room temp
1/3 c sugar + more for ramekins
1/4 c store bought dulce de leche
2 large eggs, room temp
1/2 tsp vanilla

Preheat oven to 350F. Whisk flour, salt, and baking powder in a small bowl; set aside. Coat ramekins with butter in a thin, even layer, then coat with sugar, knocking out any excess. Using an stand mixer fitted with paddle attachment, beat sugar and butter on medium high until light and fluffy, ~4 min. Add dulce de leche and continue to beat until incorporated, ~1 min. Beat in eggs, 1 at a time, until combined, followed by vanilla. Beat mixture on medium high speed 1 min (it may look slightly grainy and separated, that's ok). Reduce mixer to low and beat in dry ingredients until smooth. Divide batter among prepared ramekins. Make a small divot with a spoon in the top of each. Place frozen filling onto divots, but do not press down into batter. Place ramekins on a small rimmed baking sheet. Bake cakes until tops are browned, firm to the touch, and a tester inserted into the cakes (avoiding the liquid center) comes out clean, 23-25 min. Invert cakes on to plates to serve. If the cake is tan against filling's dark brown, it's underdone but still ok to eat.
