Brown Butter Almond Cake with Fruit
  --Sohla El-Waylly

250 g (~1 pint) pitted sweet or sour cherries, or any fruit like blackberries, blueberries, or peach slices
113 g (1/2 c) unsalted butter
75 g (6 tbsp) granulated sugar
70 g (scant 3/4 c) almond flour
70 g (1/2 c + 1 1/2 tbsp) ap flour (or any gluten-free AP blend)
3/4 tsp kosher salt
1/2 tsp baking powder
3 large eggs
75 g (1/4 c) mild honey (like clover or wildflower)
1/2 tsp vanilla paste (or 1 tsp vanilla extract)

Set a rack in the center of the oven and heat to 350F (177C). In a medium skillet over medium heat, melt the butter until foamy. Keep cooking the butter, stirring constantly with a silicone spatula, until the foaming and sputtering subsides, and the solids look deeply browned, ~3-5 min. Remove from heat. In a medium bowl, whisk together the sugar, almond flour, AP flour, salt, and baking powder. In another medium bowl, whisk the eggs until no streaks remain. Add the honey, vanilla, and almond extract (if using) and whisk until thoroughly combined. Stream in the warm brown butter while whisking until evenly combined. Add the wet ingredients to the dry and whisk until you have a smooth batter. Use a spatula to gently fold in the fruit and scrape the batter into the same skillet you browned the butter in (no need to wash or cool the pan). Bake until the top is browned and set, ~25-30 min. Run a small butter knife or offset spatula along the edges to make sure the cake is loosened from the pan, then invert onto a plate. Serve hot or cool. Store covered at room temperature for 3 days, or tightly wrap and store in the fridge for 5 days or in the freezer for 1 month.


Notes: can swap some flour for cocoa powder
