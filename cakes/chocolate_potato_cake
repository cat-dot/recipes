Chocolate Potato Cake
 --B. Dylan Hollis

Cake:
1/2 c salted butter
1 c sugar
2 eggs, beate 
1/2 c whole milk
1/2 c riced/mashed russet potato
1 c flour
2 tsp baking powder
1/2 tsp each of: cinnamon, cloves, nutmeg
1/2 c GRATED semi-sweet chocolate (2oz, or half a baking-chocolate bar)
1/2 c chopped nuts (I recommend walnuts)

Preheat oven to 350F. Set diced potato to a boil until tender. I do not peel the potato, but you can. Cream together butter & sugar until fluffy and pale. Slowly incorporate the eggs. Rice or mash potato in a separate bowl, then stir and cool with milk. Incorporate the potato & milk, mixing well. Combine flour, leavening & spices in a separate bowl. Gently incorporate the flour mixture, grated chocolate & nuts. Add batter to a buttered and floured 8x8" cake tin. Bake for 45-55 min, checking for doneness ~40 min. Cool before frosting.

Frosting:
2 tbsp salted butter
1 c sugar
1/4 c whole milk
2 oz semi sweet chocolate
1/2 tsp vanilla extract

Add all ingredients; save for vanilla, to a saucepan. Set to a LOW boil for 15 min, stirring occasionally at first. Remove from heat. Add vanilla, and beat to desired consistency. Apply frosting to the cooled cake.

Notes: Beating more will lead to a spreadable frosting - less so will lead to a thick, pourable glaze which will set wonderfully once cool. Briefly chilling the boiled frosting will help to thicken, just stir before application.
