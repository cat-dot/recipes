Texas Sheet Cake
  --Genevieve Ko

Cake:
1 c (227 g) unsalted butter, plus more for greasing the pan
2 c (215 g) chopped pecans
2 c (255 g) ap flour
2 c (400 g) granulated sugar
1 tsp baking soda
1/2 tsp fine sea salt
1/2 packed c (40 g) unsweetened natural cocoa powder
1 c hot coffee or water
1/2 c (115 g) sour cream
2 large eggs, beaten
1 tsp vanilla extract

Heat oven to 350 F. Butter a half-sheet pan (13x18x1"). Spread the pecans on a second half-sheet pan and bake until lightly toasted, 7-9 min. Meanwhile, in a large bowl, whisk the flour, sugar, baking soda and salt, and make a well in the center. In a medium saucepan over medium heat, melt the butter, stirring often. Add the cocoa powder and stir well. Then add the hot coffee and boil for 30 s, stirring continuously. Pour the mixture into the well in the dry ingredients, then fold gently just until no traces of flour remain. Set saucepan aside without washing. Whisk the sour cream, eggs and vanilla in a medium bowl. Pour into the chocolate mixture and fold gently until incorporated. Pour into the prepared pan and spread evenly. Bake until a toothpick inserted in the center comes out with a few crumbs, 18-20 min. Set the pan on a wire rack.

Icing:
3/4 c (170 g) unsalted butter
1/2 packed c (40 g) unsweetened natural cocoa powder
1/4 c (60 g) whole milk
1 tsp  vanilla extract
2 1/2 packed c (360 g) confectioners’ sugar

(start as soon as cake comes out of oven) Melt the butter in the reserved saucepan over medium heat, stirring often. Add the cocoa and stir until smooth and bubbling, then turn off the heat. Add the milk, vanilla and confectioners’ sugar, and stir until smooth. It’s OK if there are tiny lumps. Pour the warm frosting over the warm cake and spread evenly. Sprinkle the toasted pecans all over the top and gently press into the icing. Cool completely in the pan on a rack. The cake keeps, tightly wrapped, at room temperature for up to 3 days, in the refrigerator for up to 1 week and in the freezer for up to 3 months. If needed, bring to room temperature before serving.
