Preheat oven to 375 F. Blitz the peanuts in a food processor until almost peanut butter, then add beans and puree. Pour into a bowl and add honey and eggs; mix well to combine. Stir in butter and baking soda. Pour into springform pan and bake for 45 min. Let cool before releasing from pan.




Notes: didn't say anything about greasing pan but I imagine that would be a good idea
