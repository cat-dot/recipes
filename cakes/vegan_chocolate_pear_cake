Vegan Chocolate & Pear Olive Oil Skillet Cake
  --Jessie Sheehan

1 c (226 g) hot water
1/3 c (28 g) Dutch process cocoa powder
2 tsp espresso powder
1/4 c + 2 tbsp (75 g) olive oil + more for greasing
1 c (213 g) dark brown sugar
2 tsp vanilla 
1 tbsp apple cider vinegar
1 tsp baking soda
1 tsp kosher salt
1 tsp ground cinnamon
1 1/2 c (180 g) ap flour + 2 tbsp for dusting the pears
2 c (270 g, ~1 1/2 medium) pears, skin on, cored and diced into 1/2" pieces
confectioners’ sugar, for dusting

Heat the oven to 350F. Grease a 10" cast-iron skillet with olive oil. Whisk the hot water, cocoa, and espresso powder in a large mixing bowl until combined. Whisk in the oil and sugar; then the vanilla, vinegar, baking soda, salt, and cinnamon one at a time, vigorously whisking after each. Whisk in the flour until about half of it is combined with the wet ingredients. Toss the pears and 2 tbsp of flour together in a separate, medium bowl with your hands. Transfer the flour-dusted pears to the bowl with the cake batter and fold them in with a flexible spatula until the pears are completely combined and the last streak of flour just disappears. Scrape batter into prepared skillet and smooth into an even layer. Bake for 40-45 min, rotating at the halfway point, until a cake tester comes out almost clean. Let the cake come to room temperature on a cooling rack and serve slices from the pan with a dusting of confectioners’ sugar. The cake will keep tightly wrapped on the counter for 3 days.
