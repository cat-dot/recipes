Gingerbread Cake
  --America's Test Kitchen

3/4 c stout
1/2 tsp baking soda
2/3 c mild molasses
3/4 c (5 1/4 oz/149 g) packed light brown sugar
1/4 c (1 3/4 oz/50 g) sugar
1 1/2 c (7 1/2 oz/213 g) unbleached ap flour + extra for dusting pan
2 tbsp ground ginger 
1/2 tsp baking powder
1/2 tsp table salt
1/4 tsp ground cinnamon
1/4 tsp finely ground black pepper
2 large eggs
1/3 c vegetable oil
1 tbsp finely grated fresh ginger


Adjust oven rack to middle position and heat oven to 350F. Grease and flour 8" square baking pan. Bring stout to boil in medium saucepan over medium heat, stirring occasionally. Remove from heat and stir in baking soda (mixture will foam vigorously). When foaming subsides, stir in molasses, brown sugar, and sugar until dissolved; set mixture aside. Whisk flour, ground ginger, baking powder, salt, cinnamon, and pepper together in large bowl; set aside. Transfer stout mixture to large bowl. Whisk in eggs, oil, and grated ginger until combined. Whisk wet mixture into flour mixture in thirds, stirring vigorously until completely smooth after each addition.  Transfer batter to prepared pan and gently tap pan against counter 3-4 times to dislodge any large air bubbles. Bake until top of cake is just firm to touch and toothpick inserted into center comes out clean, 35-45 min. Cool cake in pan on wire rack, ~1 1/2 hr. Cut into squares and serve warm or at room temp.


Notes: If you are particularly sensitive to spice, you can decrease the amount of dried ginger to 1 tbsp. Guiness is preferred stout. Avoid opening the oven door until the minimum baking time has elapsed. If your cake pan has thin walls, you might want to wrap it with premade cake strips or make your own from cheesecloth and foil. This extra insulation will help ensure that the edges of the cake don't overbake.
