Strawberry Sheet Cake
  --Zoha

Cake:
3/4 c vegetable oil (170g)
1/4 c unsalted butter, melted (56g)
1 1/2 c sugar (300g)
3 large eggs
2 tsp vanilla
1/3 c milk (80g)
340g fresh or frozen strawberries (makes ~1 1/2 c of puree) - if using frozen, thaw at room temperature for 30 min beforehand
2 3/4 c ap flour (360g)
2 tbsp cornstarch (20g)
3/4 tsp baking soda
1 tsp baking powder
1 tsp salt

Pre-heat your oven to 350F (conventional / no fan) and line a 9x13" baking pan with parchment paper. Add the oil, melted butter, sugar, eggs and vanilla in a large bowl until the mixture is smooth (~2 min). Blitz the strawberries in the food processor until they form a puree. Leave some texture if desired! Add the strawberry puree and milk to the wet ingredients and whisk until combined. Lastly, sift in the flour, cornstarch, baking powder, baking soda and salt. Use a hand whisk to gently whisk until the ingredients are just combined and no lumps remain. Do not overmix. Pour the batter into the prepared pan and bake for ~25-30 min. Test with a toothpick inserted into the middle of the cake - it should have a few moist crumbs on it (no wet batter). Do not overbake! Let the cake cool down at room temperature.

Cream Cheese Frosting:
12oz cream cheese, room temperature (340g)
1/3 c strawberry jam of choice (80g)
1/4 c granulated sugar (60g)
1/3 c heavy cream (80g)
Pinch of salt

Add the room temperature cream cheese, strawberry jam, sugar, heavy cream and salt to a bowl. Whisk on medium-low speed until the ingredients are combined and no lumps remain. You should have a silky smooth frosting. Do not overmix as that can cause the frosting to become runnier.

Once the cake has cooled, carefully remove it from the pan (or keep it in if you want to serve in it). Slather on the cream cheese frosting, and decorate with lots of fresh, sliced strawberries. This cake is best enjoyed at room temp, however should be stored in the refrigerator.
