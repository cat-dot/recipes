Zucchini Lemon Cake
  --The Field Company

1 tbsp unsalted butter, for the skillet
3 large eggs
1/3 c Greek yogurt
1 lb zucchini (~2 medium), coarsely grated
2/3 c light brown sugar
1/3 c granulated sugar
1/3 c olive oil
2 c ap flour
1 tsp baking powder
1 tsp baking soda
1/2 tsp ground cardamom
1/4 tsp freshly grated nutmeg
1 tsp kosher salt
finely grated zest of 1 lemon (~1 tbsp)
1 tbsp turbinado or demerara sugar (optional)

Preheat the oven to 350F and position a rack in the center. Coat the inside of a 10 1/4" cast iron skillet with butter. In a large bowl, combine the eggs, yogurt, sugars, and olive oil and whisk until the eggs are broken up. Add the zucchini and stir with a spatula to combine. In another bowl, whisk together the flour, baking powder, baking soda, spices, salt, and lemon zest until well combined. Gently fold the dry ingredients into the wet ingredients. Pour the batter into the skillet. Sprinkle the top with the turbinado sugar, if using. Bake for ~40 min or until a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean. Let the bread cool in the skillet for 15 min, then transfer to a wire rack and let cool completely before serving.
