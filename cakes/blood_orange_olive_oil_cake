  --Field Company
  
2 c (250g) ap flour
1 3/4 c (350g) sugar
1/2 tsp baking soda
1/2 tsp baking powder
2 tsp kosher salt
1 1/4 c (265g) fruity extra-virgin olive oil + more for the pan
1 c (305g) whole milk
1/4 c (75g) Greek yogurt or sour cream
3 large eggs
2 tbsp finely grated blood orange zest (from 2 oranges), or other citrus zest
1/4 c (60g) fresh blood orange juice (from 2 oranges), or other citrus juice
Confectioner’s sugar, for dusting (optional)

Preheat the oven to 350 F. Brush the bottom and side of a 10" cast iron skillet with olive oil. Set the pan inside a rimmed baking sheet. In a large bowl, whisk together the flour, sugar, baking soda, baking powder, and salt. In another bowl, whisk together the olive oil, milk, yogurt, eggs, blood orange zest and juice. Pour the wet ingredients over the flour mixture and whisk until smooth. Pour the batter into the prepared pan and bake for 1 hr, or until the top is golden and a cake tester inserted into the center of the cake comes out clean. (The cake should rise slightly above the edge of the skillet.) Remove from the oven and let the cake cool to room temperature in the skillet, 1-2 hr. Dust the top of the cake with confectioner’s sugar (if using), then cut into slices and serve.
