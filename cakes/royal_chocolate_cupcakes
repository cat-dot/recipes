Chocolate Cupcakes with Buttercream Frosting
 --The Queen's Pastry Chef
 
Cupcakes:
15 g vinegar
300 ml milk
50 ml vegetable oil
60 g butter, melted and cool
2 eggs
5 ml vanilla
250 g self raising flour
75 g cocoa powder
300 g caster sugar
10 g baking soda
100 g white chocolate chips (can sub nuts/dried fruit/etc)

Preheat oven to 150C. Combine flour, sugar, cocoa, and baking soda into a mixing bowl. Whisk eggs in a separate jug, with vanilla, butter, oil, milk, and vinegar. Slowly add wet to dry, little by little. Ensure the batter is smooth with no lumps. Add chocolate chips. Equally divide batter into 15 cupcake wrappers, placing filled on a tray. Bake for ~15-18 min, take out of the oven when golden and springy to touch. Let cool.

Buttercream:
90 g dark chocolate (high %), melted
100 g butter
125 g icing sugar

Cream sugar and butter together, until light and creamy. Add in the warm melted chocolate. Can either spoon, spatula, or be fancy and put frosting into a piping bag. 



Notes: icing sugar is powdered or confectioners'; caster sugar aka baker's sugar, superfine sugar, can swap 1:1 for regular granulated sugar
