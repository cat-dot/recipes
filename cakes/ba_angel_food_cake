Angel Food Cake
  --Claire Saffitz
  
1 c cake flour, sifted
2/3 c powdered sugar
1 3/4 c egg whites (12-14 large eggs)
1 1/2 tsp cream of tartar
1 tsp kosher salt
2/3 c sugar
2 tbsp fresh lemon juice
2 tsp vanilla

Preheat oven to 325F. Whisk four and powdered sugar in a medium bowl. Beat whites, cream of tartar, and salt in the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with the whisk attachments on medium low speed to break up whites, ~30 s. Increase speed to medium high and beat until whites are very foamy and barely form soft peaks, ~45 s longer. Gradually add sugar and continur to beat on medium high speed until whites are firm and glossy and hold stiff peaks. Beat in lemon juice and vanilla. If you overbeat, the meringue will look dry, grainy, and curdled. Remove bowl from mixer. Sift 1/3 dry ingredients over meringue. Return bowl to mixer and beat on low speed until incorporated. Remove bowl from mixer again and repeat sifting and mixing process 2 more times. Remove bowl again and fold batter several times with a large flexible spatula, scraping and lifting batter from the bottom to make sure all ingredients are fully incorporated. Scrape ~1/2 batter into ungreased tube pan. Using a spoon or small offset spatula, push batter around bottom of pan, into corners, and up sides and center tube; it's ok if batter forms a trough, with the center at a lower level than the outer edges. Scrape remaining batter into pan, spreading evenly and smoothing top. Bake cake until top is puffed, split, golden, and springs back firmly when touched and a tester inserted into center comes out clean, 35-40 min. Immediately invert pan, placing hollow part of tue over long necked glass bottle (wine) to elevate it, or if your pan has feet, simply rest upside down. Let cool at least 1 hr, then turn right side up. Using thin metal spatula, loosen cake from bottom. Invert cake on a plate or cake stand and remove bottom. Serve. Cake can be made 1 day ahead; wrap in plastic and store at room temp.
