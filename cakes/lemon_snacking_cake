Lemon Snacking Cake
  --Melissa Clark, NYT cooking

1/2 c neutral oil (ex. grapeseed)
3 lemons
1/2 c sour cream
1/4 c coconut milk
2 large eggs
1 1/2 c ap flour
1 1/4 c sugar
1 tsp baking powder
1/4 tsp baking soda
1/2 tsp fine sea salt
1/2 c packed shredded sweetened coconut

Heat oven to 350F; grease a 9x9" pan and line with parchment paper, creating a sling. Grate 2 tbsp zest from the lemons, and juice so that you have 1/4 c. Add juice and zest to medium bowl, then whisk in oil, sour cream, coconut milk, and eggs. In a large bowl, whisk together the flour, sugar, baking powder, baking soda, and salt. Whisk wet ingredients into dry until smooth. Scrape batter into pan, spreading it out evenly; top with shredded coconut. Bake until top springs back when lightly pressed in the center, and a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean, 35-45 min. Let cool completely. 

Glaze:
3 tbsp coconut milk
1 tbsp coconut oil, melted
pinch fine sea salt
2/3 c confectioners' sugar
finely grated lemon zest for garnish

When cake is cool make the glaze. In a small bowl whisk together the coconut milk, oil, and salt. Whisk in the sugar until smooth. Pour over the cake and sprinkle with lemon zest. Let cake stand for at least 30 min before serving.
