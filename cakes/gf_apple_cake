Gluten Free Tender Apple Cake
  --Nicole Hunn

1 1/2 lb baking apples (~3 large) peeled, cored and diced (a mix of Empire, Gala, and green apples works really well)
1 1/2 tsp cinnamon
1 tbsp fresh squeezed lemon juice
1 c + 2 tbsp (158g) ap gf flour (better batter)
1/2 tsp xantham gum (if flour doesn't already have)
1 tsp baking powder
1/2 tsp kosher salt
1/8 tsp freshly ground nutmeg
10 tbsp (140g) unsalted butter, melted and cooled
1 c (200g) sugar
2 eggs roomt temp, beaten
1 tsp vanilla

Preheat oven to 325F; grease 9" cake round, set aside. Place diced apples in a large bowl and toss with 1 tsp cinnamon and lemon juice, set aside. In another bowl, place flour, xantham gum (if using), baking powder, salt, nutmeg, and remaining cinnamon; whisk to combine and set aside. In a separate large bowl with a hand mixer or the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with the paddle attachment, cream the butter until light and fluffy. Add the sugar, then the eggs and vanilla, beating to combine well after each addition. Add the dry ingredients in 2 batches, beating until just combined after each addition. The batter will be thick but light. Scrape ~2/3 of the cake batter into the bowl of apples, and mix to coat all of the apples in the batter. It will be very chunky. Scrape the remaining 1/3 of the cake batter into the prepared cake pan and spread into an even layer with a moistened spatula. Scrape the chunky apple-packed cake batter into the pan on top of the base layer of batter, and spread again into an even layer with a moistened spatula. Cover the pan tightly with foil , and place in the center of the preheated oven. Bake for 20 min. Remove the foil cover from the pan and return to the oven to bake until a toothpick inserted into the center comes out with no more than a few moist crumbs attached, ~20 min. Remove from the oven and allow to cool in the pan for 10 min before carefully transferring to a rack for ~15 min before slicing and serving.
