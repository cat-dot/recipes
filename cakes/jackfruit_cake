Jackfruit Upside-Down Cake

Caramel:
6 tbsp unsalted butter, softened + more for greasing
1/2 c granulated sugar
1 lb fresh jackfruit flesh, seeded and halved

Preheat oven to 350F and grease a 9" cake pan. In a medium saucepan, cook the sugar over medium-high heat, stirring as needed, until an amber caramel has formed, 2-3 min. Add the softened butter and cook, stirring constantly until emulsified, 1-2 min. Immediately pour into the prepared cakepan, spreading to cover the entire bottom. Arrange the jackfruit, cut side up, over the caramel.

Batter:
1 c ap flour
1 tsp baking pawder
1/2 tsp salt
1 c light brown sugar
8 tbsp unsalted butter, melted and cooled
1 tsp vanilla
2 eggs + 2 egg yolks

In a small bowl, whisk the flour, baking powder, and salt. In a medium bowl, whisk together the sugar, butter, vanilla, eggs, and yolks. Fold the dry ingredients into the wet until a smooth batter is formed. Pour the batter over the jackfruit in an even layer and smoothe top with a rubber spatula. Bake until the top of the cake is golden brown and toothpick inserted in the middle comes out clean, 35-40 min. Remove the cake from the oven and let it cool slightly on a wire rack, 5-10 min.

Toffee Sauce:
1 c half & half
1 c light brown sugar
8 tbsp unsalted butter
1 tbsp lime juice
1/2 tsp vanilla
1/2 tsp salt

In a medium saucepan, bring the half & half, sugar, and butter to a boil over medium high heat. Cook, stirring constantly, until the sugar dissolves and the mixture has slightly thickened, 4 min. Stir in the lime juice, vanilla, and salt and cook for 2 min. Transfer to a bowl and let cool completely.

Serving:
Slice the cake and drizzle with toffee sauce. Can server with a scoop of ice cream.
