Chocolate Lava Cake
  --Sur la Table

2 oz unsalted butter, cut into 1” cubes, + more for buttering ramekins
3 oz bittersweet chocolate, finely chopped
1 egg
1 egg yolk
3 tbsp granulated sugar
pinch Kosher salt
Confectioners’ sugar, optional garnish
Fresh fruit, optional garnish

Preheat oven to 375F and position rack in middle of oven. Butter 2x6 oz ramekins. To a medium saucepan, add enough water to reach to 2" and set over medium-low heat; bring to a simmer. To a medium heatproof bowl, add chocolate and butter. Set over simmering water, making sure the bottom of the bowl does not touch the water. Cook, stirring with silicone spatula, until chocolate and butter are melted and smooth. Remove from the heat. While the chocolate is melting, in the bowl of a stand mixer, fitted with a whip attachment, whip the egg and egg yolk with granulated sugar on medium- high until pale and light yellow, ~4 min. Reduce the speed to low and gradually pour in the chocolate mixture until combined. Spoon the batter into the prepared ramekins and set on a baking sheet. Bake until the edges are set, but the center is underdone, ~10 min. Cool slightly, 2-3 min prior to serving. Invert the lava cakes out of the ramekins and serve immediately with a dusting of confectioners’ sugar and fresh fruit.
