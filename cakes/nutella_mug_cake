3 Ingredient Flourless Nutella Cake

1/4 c Nutella
1 large egg
1/2 tbsp dutch process cocoa powder

Combine all ingredients in an oversized microwave-safe mug. Mix vigorously with a small whisk until batter is smooth and egg has been completely mixed in. Cook in microwave for about 1 minute 10 seconds. Cake should be set but may be slightly wet on top. Let cake cool for 15 minutes before serving. Cake will condense down during this cooling process. You can replate in a smaller mug/plate/ramekin before serving. You can top with powdered sugar or chocolate syrup.
