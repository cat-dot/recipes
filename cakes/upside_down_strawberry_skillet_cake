Upside Down Strawberry Skillet Cake
--Kelli Foster

Butter or cooking spray
1 1/4 c sugar, divided
2 tbsp cornstarch
1 tsp ground ginger
1 lb strawberries, hulled and sliced into thin rounds
1 c ap flour
1/2 c finely ground cornmeal
1 1/2 tsp baking powder
1/2 tsp salt
2 large eggs
6 tbsp unsalted butter, melted and cooled
1/2 c whole milk
1 tsp vanilla

Arrange a rack in the middle of the oven and heat to 350Â°F. Cut out a round of parchment paper and line the bottom of a 10-inch cast iron skillet. Coat the skillet with butter or cooking spray. Whisk 1/2 c of the sugar, cornstarch, and ginger together in a medium bowl. Add the strawberries and stir so the berries are fully coated; set aside. Whisk together the remaining 3/4 c sugar, flour, cornmeal, baking powder, and salt in a large bowl. Add the eggs, butter, milk, and vanilla and mix with a hand mixer on medium speed just until smooth, ~1 min. Spread the strawberries in an even layer in the prepared skillet. Pour the batter over the strawberries and use a rubber spatula to spread in an even layer. Bake until the cake is lightly browned and springs back when lightly touched, 30-35 min. Let the cake cool in the skillet for at least 15 min, then run a knife along the edge of the pan. Invert the cake onto a large plate and carefully remove the layer of parchment. Serve warm or at room temperature, sliced into wedges.
