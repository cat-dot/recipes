Coconut-Lemon Crepe Cake

Crepes:
2 c whole milk
1½ c all-purpose flour
¼ c granulated sugar
1 tsp kosher salt
1 tsp lemon zest
1 tsp coconut extract
4 eggs + 4 yolks
1 stick unsalted butter, melted, plus more for greasing

In a blender, combine all of the crepe ingredients and blend until smooth. Transfer to a bowl and chill for 1 hr. After chilling, grease 2 10" skillets and heat over medium heat. Staggering about 1 minapart, add ¼ c of the crepe batter to each pan and quickly swirl to coat the entire pan surface with a thin layer of batter. Cook until the crepe just begins to change color, 1-2 min, then flip and cook for 1-2 min more, transfer to a plate to cool. Continue the process, working between the 2 pans and stacking the cooked crepes on a plate to cool until you have 18 crepes total. Place the crepes in the refrigerator and chill for 1 hr.

Filling:
14 oz can coconut cream
2 c mascarpone
1 c confectioners' sugar
1 tbsp lemon juice
1 tbsp lemon zest
1 tsp kosher salt

In a large bowl, beat the coconut cream with an electric hand mixer until soft peaks form. Add the remaining filling ingredients and mix until smooth.

Assembly:
Confectioners' sugar
Toasted coconut flakes
Lemon zest

Once the crepes have chilled, grease a 9" springform pan with butter. Lay one crepe down on the bottom, then top with ¼ c of the filling. Using a mini offset spatula, spread the filling into an even layer. Continue this process until all the crepes have been used. Cover with plastic wrap and refrigerate for 4 hrs until the filling has set. Use a paring knife to release the crepe cake from the springform pan. Garnish with confectioners' sugar, toasted coconut and lemon zest, then serve.
