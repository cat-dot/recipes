Melting Sweet Potatoes
  --Rebecca, Foodie with Family

3 lb sweet potatoes roughly equally sized
3 tbsp melted butter or melted extra virgin coconut oil
3 tbsp garlic evoo or plain olive oil
1 1/4 tsp kosher salt
1 tsp ground black pepper
3 garlic cloves peeled and thinly sliced or chopped
1 1/4 c vegetable broth

Preheat oven to 500F. Peel the sweet potatoes and cut into 1" thick rounds. Arrange on a half sheet pan with space between the slices to allow for air to circulate. Drizzle the potatoes with the butter or coconut oil and the garlic evoo or plain evoo. Sprinkle the salt and pepper over the top. Use your hands to flip the sweet potatoes and slide them around in the oils, making sure they're completely coated. Roast the sweet potatoes for 15 min, or until the undersides of the slices have caramelized to a beautiful deep brown. Carefully flip the sweet potato slices and return the pan to the oven for another 15 min. Flip the sweet potato slices once again and scatter the chopped or sliced garlic over the sweet potato slices and then pour the vegetable broth over the works. Return the pan to the oven for another 15 min, or until the potatoes are completely tender and the broth has reduced to a thicker consistency. Use a spatula to transfer the Melting Sweet Potatoes to a serving plate and drizzle the sauce from the pan over them.
