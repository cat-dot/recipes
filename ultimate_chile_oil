Ultimate Chile Oil
  --Mandy Lee @ladyandpups

2 tbsp shoyu
4 garlic cloves, grated
1/2 c (50 g) Sichuan (spicier) or Korean (milder) chile flakes (I don’t recommend using any other kind)
1 star anise pod
2 tsp ground coriander
1 1/2 tsp ground cumin
1/4 tsp curry powder
2 c canola oil
3 tbsp white sesame seeds
2 dried bay leaves
2 tbsp finely ground Sichuan peppercorns

Mix the shoyu and grated garlic together. Set aside. Using a spice grinder, grind the chile flakes, star anise pod, coriander, cumin, and curry powder into a fine powder. In a large saucepan at least 6" (15 cm) deep, combine the spice powder with the oil, sesame seeds, and bay leaves. Set it over medium heat and bring the mixture to a gentle boil. Boil for 3 min, stirring frequently, until the chile flakes have turned maroon in color (but not black!). When the chile flakes have turned to the desired color, turn off the heat immediately, then add the ground Sichuan peppercorns. Stir and let fry in the residual heat for ~30 s, then add the shoyu/garlic mixture. The oil will boil up a little due to the added moisture (which is why we’re using a deep pot). Just keep stirring until the sizzling has died down. Let the chile oil sit at room temperature for at least 2 hr (or best overnight) before using. Keep in an airtight jar in the fridge for up to 3 months.
