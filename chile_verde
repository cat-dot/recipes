  --Traci Des Jardins

4 lbs pork butt (shoulder)
2 lbs tomatillos, husks removed
1 lb anaheim or poblani chiles
6 cloves garlic, peeled and roughly chopped
2 yellow onions, peeled
1 bunch cilantro, washed
1 tsp cumin
1/2 tsp dried oregano
flour, salt, and pepper
2 tbsp vegetable oil

Cut meat into 1 1/2" cubes. Cut the tomatillos into quarters, the chilies into 1/" pieces, and dice the onions into 1/2" pieces. Remove the large stems from the cilantro and chop roughly. Lay the meat out onto a tray and sprinkle generously with salt and pepper; sprinkle with flour and toss until coated. Place a heavy skillet onto the stove over medium high heat, when hot add the oil and fry the pork until golden brown on all sides. Remove the meat from the pan and add the vegetables, cook over low heat until soft; add the meat, spices, and herbs to the pan, cover just to the top of the meat with water and bring to a simmer. Simmer for 2 hrs or until the pork is tender.
