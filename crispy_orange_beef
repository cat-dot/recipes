Crispy Orange Beef
  --America's Test Kitchen

1 1/2 lb beef flap meat, trimmed
3 tbsp shoyu
6 tbsp cornstarch
10x3" strips orange peel, sliced thin lengthwise (1/4 c) + 1/4 c juice (2 oranges)
3 tbsp molasses
2 tbsp Shaoxing wine or dry sherry
1 tbsp rice vinegar
1 1/2 tsp toasted sesame oil
3 c vegetable oil
1 jalapeño chile, stemmed, seeded, and sliced thin lengthwise
3 garlic cloves, minced
2 tbsp grated fresh ginger
1/2 tsp red pepper flakes
2 scallions, sliced thin on bias

Cut beef along grain into 2 1/2-3" wide lengths. Slice each piece against grain into 1/2" thick slices. Cut each slice lengthwise into 1/2" wide strips. Toss beef with 1 tbsp shoyu in bowl. Add cornstarch and toss until evenly coated. Spread beef in single layer on wire rack set in rimmed baking sheet. Transfer sheet to freezer until meat is very firm but not completely frozen, ~45 min. Whisk remaining 2 tbsp shoyu, orange juice, molasses, Shaoxing wine, vinegar, and sesame oil together in bowl. Line second rimmed baking sheet with triple layer of paper towels. Heat vegetable oil in large Dutch oven over medium heat until oil registers 375F. Carefully add one-third of beef and fry, stirring occasionally to keep beef from sticking together, until golden brown, ~1 1/2 min. Using spider, transfer meat to paper towel–lined sheet. Return oil to 375F and repeat twice more with remaining beef. After frying, reserve 2 tbsp frying oil. Heat reserved oil in 12" skillet over medium-high heat until shimmering. Add orange peel and jalapeño and cook, stirring occasionally, until about half of orange peel is golden brown, 1 1/2 - 2 min. Add garlic, ginger, and ­pepper flakes; cook, stirring frequently, until garlic is beginning to brown, ~45 s. Add shoyu mixture and cook, scraping up any browned bits, until slightly thickened, ~45 s. Add beef and scallions and toss. Transfer to platter and serve immediately.
