Mama Chang's pork and chive dumplings

6-8 large napa cabbage leaves
1⁄2 bunch garlic chives
1 pound ground pork
1 tablespoon chopped fresh ginger
2 teaspoons sesame oil
3 tablespoons soy sauce
Round dumpling wrappers
2-3 tablespoons cooking oil

Slice the cabbage thinly, place in a large bowl and salt generously with about 1-2 tablespoons of kosher salt. Let sit for 10 minutes.  

Mince garlic chives. Mix together pork, ginger, garlic chives, sesame oil, and soy sauce. Squeeze cabbage to take out all of the water, add to pork mixture and mix well. Make dumplings (dumplings may be made in advance and frozen tightly wrapped). 

To cook dumplings, place oil in a large flat skillet and heat on high. Add dumplings and immediately turn down to medium low. Cook, checking bottoms of dumplings, until golden brown. Add about 1⁄4 cup water to pan and cover immediately (be careful as the water will can sputtering and steaming). Let cook for a few minutes and add another 1⁄4 cup of water when the water evaporates. Cover and cook again. Add one final 1⁄4 cup of water and cover and cook again. 

Dumplings are done when the water totally evaporates and the bottoms are brown and crispy. Serve with dumpling sauce.
