Mini Cheesecakes
  --King Arthur Flour Company, Inc

Crust:
1 c unbleached ap flour
1/3 c almond flour or ground almonds
2 tbsp brown sugar
1/4 tap salt
6 tbsp (3 oz) butter, cold

Preheat your oven to 425F. Whisk together the flour, almond flour, sugar and salt. Cut in the butter with a pastry blender or two knives, or rub together with your fingers until the mixture resembles coarse sand. Sprinkle in a tsp or two of water if the dough is too crumbly to hold together when squeezed. Divide the crumbs among the 12 cups of a mini cheesecake pan. Press them firmly to the bottoms and ~1/2" up the sides. Bake in the preheated oven for 8-10 min, until set and just beginning to color. Remove from the oven and let cool. Reduce the oven temperature to 325F.


Batter:
8 oz (1 large package) cream cheese, room temperature
1/4 c sugar
2 tbsp heavy cream, or sour cream
1 large egg
1 tsp vanilla

Optional Swirl-ins
1 oz bittersweet or semisweet chocolate, melted
2 tbsp good-quality jam, warmed slightly and stirred until smooth

In a medium-sized bowl, beat the cream cheese and sugar until smooth. Add the cream, egg and vanilla; mix well. Spoon the batter into the cooled crusts, using about 2 tablespoons in each. Top with a scant half teaspoon of melted chocolate or jam, if desired, and use a knife blade to swirl it into the batter. Bake the cheesecakes for 18 to 20 minutes, until just set. Remove from the oven and let cool for at least 30 minutesâ€”the tops will sink slightly. Use a knife to gently loosen the edges, then carefully invert the pan and push the cheesecakes out. Immediately turn the cheesecakes right-side up and chill them. To remove the metal plates before serving, run the blade of a table knife under hot water to warm it, then run the knife between the crust and the metal disk to free up the cheesecake.
