Spinach Artichoke Pasta
  --Natasha Bull

12 oz uncooked pasta
1 tbsp olive oil
1/2 medium onion chopped
3 cloves garlic minced
1/2 c chicken or vegetable broth
8 oz cream cheese (1 block Philly) softened
1/4 tsp Italian seasoning
14 oz can artichoke hearts drained and chopped
3 c (packed) fresh baby spinach
1/2 c freshly grated parmesan cheese
salt & pepper to taste

Ensure the cream cheese is very soft (you may want to microwave it for 30 s or more if you haven't had it sitting out on your counter for a couple hrs). Boil a pot of salted water for the pasta and cook it al dente according to package directions. You will need to reserve some pasta water before draining it. Meanwhile, add the oil and onion to a skillet and sauté over medium high heat for 4-5 min. Stir in the garlic and cook for 30 s. Reduce the heat to medium and add the broth, cream cheese, and Italian seasoning to the pan. Stir until the cream cheese has mostly melted in (some lumps are ok)… this should take ~3-4 min. Reserve ~1 c of the hot pasta water prior to draining the pasta (you likely won't use it all). Take the skillet off the heat, then add the artichokes and spinach, along with a few tbsp of the hot pasta water. Toss (either use tongs or two fairly large spoons) and add more of the pasta water gradually until the sauce is thinned to your liking and the spinach is starting to wilt. Stir the parmesan into the sauce. Add the drained pasta to the skillet and toss. Add a splash more of the hot pasta water if needed. Season with salt & pepper (I'm generous with both). Serve immediately.


Notes: 8-12 oz. of pasta will work for this recipe
