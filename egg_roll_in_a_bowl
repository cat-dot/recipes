Egg Roll in a Bowl
  --Kaitlin, thewoksoflife

2-3 tbsp neutral oil
1 lb ground chicken, pork, or beef
2 cloves garlic (minced)
24 oz cole slaw mix
2 scallions (thinly sliced with the green and white parts separated)
1/2 c water (divided)
1 1/2 tbsp brown sugar
1 1/4 tsp salt
1/4 tsp five spice powder
1/4 tsp white pepper
1 tsbp hoisin sauce
1 tbsp shoyu
1 tsp sesame oil
Sesame seeds and wonton chips for topping (optional)

Heat a wok or large, deep skillet over high heat. When it just starts smoking, add the oil (2 tbsp for ground pork/beef, or 3 tbsp for leaner ground chicken) and the ground meat. Break up the meat, cooking until there’s no pink left, and it’s golden around the edges. Transfer to a dish and set aside, leaving behind any residual oil in the pan. Add the garlic and white parts of the scallions, and fry for 20-30 s. Add the cole slaw mix, and cook until wilted. Add 1/4 c of water if the pan starts to dry out. This will also help steam the vegetables. While that’s happening, mix your sauce: brown sugar, salt, five spice powder, white pepper, hoisin sauce, shoyu, sesame oil, and another 1/4 c water. Add the meat back in to the pan, along with the green parts of the scallions, reserving a generous pinch for garnish later. Add the sauce, and toss until well-combined. To serve, top with scallions, sesame seeds, and wonton chips for an aromatic crunch. You can also serve it with duck sauce and hot mustard on the side, or over a bed of grains (rice, quinoa, etc.).



Notes: can use broccoli slaw mix; can add celery/grated carrots/etc; can sub tofu for meat
