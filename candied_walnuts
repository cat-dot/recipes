Candied Walnuts
  --Joyce, Pups with Chopsticks

2 c walnuts
3 1/2 tbsp sugar
1 1/2 tbsp oil or butter
1/4 tsp salt (optional)

Preheat oven to 350F. Bring water to a boil over medium high heat; add walnuts and boil for 4-5 min. Drain walnuts and pour into small/med bowl. Immediately add sugar and mix well. Once sugar has dissolved, add in the oil and mix well. Line a rimmed baking sheet with parchment paper and pour the nuts into a single layer onto prepared pan. Roast nuts for 10 min; take nuts out and flip, then return to the oven for another 10 min. If the nuts don't look brown/roasted enough, put them back in for another 5 min. Let cool for 30-40 min before storing or eating.

Can pan fry instead of baking - set burner to low heat, add 1-2 tbsp of oil to pan. Add nuts and toast for 10-15 min, keeping them moving and in a single layer so that they don't burn. Pour them out onto a plate or sheet lined with parchment paper and spread out into a single layer to cool. Let cool for 30-40 min before eating or storing. Will most likely have to do this in batches. 


Notes: Can use pecans in place of walnuts. This works with coarse raw sugar, demerara sugar, granulated white sugar, and powdered sugar. Store them in an airtight container in a cool dry place for up to 2 weeks.
