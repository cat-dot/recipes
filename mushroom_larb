Spicy Mushroom Larb
  --Andy Baraghani

1/4 c roasted, skinless peanuts
4 tbsp vegetable oil, divided
12 oz shiitake mushrooms, stems removed, quartered
3 scallions, thinly sliced
2 garlic cloves, finely grated
1" piece ginger, peeled, finely grated
kosher salt
1 medium shallot, thinly sliced into rings, rinsed, drained
1 red chile (holland, fresno, or thai) thinly sliced
1 c mint leaves, torn if large
1 tbsp fish sauce
1/4 head green cabbage, halved crosswise, leaves separated
lime wedges (for serving)

Coarsely chop or crush peanuts into small pieces, set aside. Heat 3 tbsp oil in large nonstick skillet over medium high until shimmering. Add mushrooms and cook, undisturbed, until bottom sides are golden brown, ~5 min. Toss and continue to cook, tossing occasionally and reducing heat as needed to avoid scorching, until golden brown all over, ~4 min more. Add scallions, garlic, and ginger, followed by remaining oil, and cook, stirring often, until softened and fragrant, ~2 min. Remove from heat; season lightly with salt. Mix in shallot, chile, mint, fish sauce, and half of peanuts. Taste and adjust seasoning as needed. Transfer to large bowl; serve with cabbage, lime wedges, and remaining peanuts.
