Cheese Crusted Chicken Tenders

1 1/2 lbs boneless, skinless chicken breasts, patted dry with paper towel (3 medium)
1 1/4 tsp kosher salt divided + more to taste
3 tbsp evoo divided
1 medium carrot, peeled and finely diced (1/2 c)
1 celery stalk, finely diced (1/4 c)
1/4 c celery leaves
1/4 c basil leaves
1 1/4 c panko
3/4 c (1 1/4 oz) freshly grated grana padano cheese divided
1 lemon sliced into thin wedges for serving

Preheat oven to 400F and lined a rimmed baking sheet with parchment paper. Thinly slice each chicken breast on the bias into 3-4 3/" thick pieces. Pound each piece to an even thickness of 1/4" and transfer to a small baking dish. Season the chicken evenly with 3/4 tsp salt and drizzle with 1 tbsp of olive oil. Set aside. In a food processor, combine the carrot, celery, celery leaves, and basil, and process until the mixture becomes a fine vegetable pulp, stopping occasionally to scrape down the sides. Transfer the pulp to a large bowl, along with the panko, 1/2 c of the cheese, and the remaining salt, tossing with your hands to mix. Working 1 at a time, place the oiled chicken piece into the panko mix, coating both sides well, and place onto the prepared sheet pan. Drizzle with the remaining olive oil and top with the remaining cheese. Bake until the crust is golden brown and the chicken is cooked through, 20-25 min. 

**When slicing the chicken breasts, start two to three inches from the smaller end, slicing at an angle toward the tip. When reaching the larger end of the chicken breast, butterfly it open, naturally creating a half-inch slice.**
