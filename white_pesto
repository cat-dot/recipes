White Pesto Pasta
  --Carla Lalli Music

1/2 c walnuts
kosher salt
4 oz fresh ricotta
zest of 1 lemon
1 garlic clove, finely grated
2 tsp finely chopped oregano
2 ox finely grated parmesan (~1 1/2 c) + more for serving
1/4 c evoo
freshly ground black pepper
1 lb tube or rod shaped pasta (eg. buccatini, rigatoni, spaghetti)

Toast walnuts on rimmed baking sheet in 350F oven, tossing once, until golden brown, 6-8 min. Cool, then finely chop. Bring large pot of generously salted water to boil. Vigorously mix walnuts, ricotta, zest, garlic, oregano, and 2 oz parmesan in a large bowl until well combined. Add oil 1 tbsp or so at a time, stirring well after each addition, until all the oil is incorporated. Season with salt and pepper. Cook pasta, stirring occasionally, until al dente per package instrcutions. Scoop 1 c pasta liquid into bowl with pesto and stir gently to combine. Transfer cooked pasta into bowl with pesto (ok if water comes along for the ride). Mix energetically for 2 min until pesto is thick ennough to coat pasta; the pasta should have sauce clinging to it but there should also be some extra sauce that collects in bottom of bowl. Serve with parmesan.
