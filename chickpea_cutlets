Doublebatch Chickpea Cutlets
  --Veganomicon Isa Chandra

16 oz can chickpeas, drained and rinsed
1/4 c evoo
1c vital wheat gluten
1 c plain breadcrumbs
1/2 c vegetable broth or water
1/4 c shoyu
1 tsp dried thyme
1 tsp paprika
1/2 tsp dried sage
oil for frying
4 cloves garlic, pressed or grated (optional)
1 tsp lemon zest (optional)

In a mixing bowl, mash chickpeas together with the oil until no whole chickpeas are left. You can pulse in a food processor, just be careful not to make hummus. Can put garlic in as well, just pulse before adding chickpeas and transfer to a mixing bowl when done. Add the remaining ingredients and knead together for ~3 min, until strings of gluten form. Preheat a large heavy bottomed skillet over low-medium heat (cast iron works best). Divide the dough into 2 equal pieces; then divide each of those into 4 separate pieces. To form cutlets, knead each piece in your hand for a few moments and then flatten and stretch into roughly 4x6" rectangle. Add a thin layer of oil to the bottom of the pan. Place the cutlets in the pan and cook on each side for 6-7 min. Add more oil as needed when flipping the cutlets. They're ready when lightly browned and firm to the touch. They cook more thoroughly if you cover the pan between flips. Also good to use spatula to press down while cooking to get even crisp. Let rest before serving.

Notes: Best results when thickness was < 1/2" (more like 1/4"). Can use panko crumbs, sometimes additional seasoning from the crumbs is welcome. Can change up the spices, cannellini beans also work.
