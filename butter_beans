Butter Beans
  --Patch Troffer

dry beans (butter, coroan, or baby lima)
salt
water
fat (smaltz, bacon fat, oil, etc)
garlic
charred lemon
fresh herbs (mint, oregano, etc)
coriander seed
sherry vinegar
garlic aioli (for serving)
toasted bread crumbs (for sreving)

Put beans in a big bowl, cover with water, and refrigerate overnight. Transfer to big pot for cooking. Add garlic and fat, should be 1" or so sitting on surface. Salt water generously. Add herbs now (save some for later) and lemon. Add any spices you are using like coriander seed. Cook the beans at a bare simmer or just under and stir gently. Once they seem mostly done, add more herbs and salt. Stir in a "good glug" of vinegar and more herbs. Remove from heat and serve, adding a dollup of aioli and a sprinkling of bread crumbs, and maybe even fresh ground black pepper.


Notes: Best beans are butter beans from Iacopi Farms, can use good butter beans, corona, or baby lima. For charred lemon, heat up a dry small skillet, slice lemon in half, place cut side down and cook until surface is charred, 3-4 min. For toasting bread crumbs, heat oil up in skillet, toss in torn/processed bread crumbs until they get toasty brown and crisp; salt to taste. Drain bread crumbs on a paper towel lined plate.
