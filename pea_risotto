Pea Risotto with Fried Quail Eggs and Ham

Puree:
1/2 c frozen peas, thawed
1/2 c frozen spinach, thawed
1/2 c parsley leaves
1/4 c water

In a blender, combine all the ingredients and blend until smooth. Keep in the refrigerator until ready to use.

Risotto:
vegetable oil for frying
4 oz serrano ham, sliced lengthwise into 1/2" strips
6 c chicken stock
3 c water
1/4 c olive oil
1 large yellow onion, finely chopped
4 garlic cloves, minced
2 c aborio rice
1 c white wine
6 tbsp unsalted butter
1 c frozen peas
1/3 c grated parmesan cheese
kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper to taste
fried quail eggs for serving
chopped chives for garnish
lemon wedges for serving

In a medium saucepan, heat 1" of vegetable oil to 350F and line a plate with paper towels. Working in batches, fry the ham until golden and crisp, 30 s. Transfer to the prepared plate to drain. In another medium saucepan, bring the chicken stock and water to a boil, then reduce the heat to a very low simmer. In a 6 quart dutch oven, heat the olive oil over medium high heat. Add the onions and cook, stirring frequently, until softened and translucent, 4 min. Add the garlic and continue to stir until fragrant, 2-3 min. Add the rice and cook until toasted and beginning to stick to the bottom of the pan. Pour in the wine and cook, stirring constantly, until the wine is completely evaporated, 2-3 min. Ladle 2 c of the simmering stock mixture over the rice. Stir almost constantly until the liquid is completely absorbed, 5 min. Continue this process of adding stock and stirring until absorbed until the stock is gone and the rice is tender and creamy, 20-25 min. Remove from the heat and stir in the butter vigorously until emulsified. Stir in the green puree, frozen peas, and cheese, then season with salt and pepper. Divide the risotto between plates and top each with fried ham, a fried egg, chives, and a squeeze of lemon, then serve.
