One Pot French Onion Pasta
  --Elaine, Wandering Chickpea

1/4 c olive oil
3 yellow onions, thinly sliced
4 garlic cloves, minced
8 oz cremini mushrooms, sliced
1 tbsp fresh thyme
1/2 c dry white wine
2 tbsp all purpose flour
2 c beef broth (or vegetable broth)
2 c water
12 oz dried orecchiette or other short cut pasta
1 tbsp sherry vinegar
salt and freshly ground black pepper to taste
fresh herbs and toasted breadcrumbs for serving (optional)

Heat oil over a large skillet over medium heat. When shimmering, add the onions and a generous pinch of salt. Cook, stirring frequently until deeply caramelized ~25-30 min. Add the garlic, mushrooms and thyme. Saut√© for 3-4 min or until the mushrooms begin to soften. Add the wine to deglaze the pan and add the flour. Cook for another 2-3 min, until thickened. Pour in the beef stock (or vegetable stock) and water. Season with salt and freshly ground black pepper. Bring to a boil then add the pasta and cook for 8-10 minutes or until al dente. (Keep in mind that other pasta shapes will have different cook times). Turn off the heat and stir in the sherry vinegar. Serve warm.
