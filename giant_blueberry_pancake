Giant Blueberry Pancake
  --Carla Lalli

1 c ap flour
1/3 c cornmeal (medium or fine ground)
2 large eggs
1/4 c sugar
1 tbsp baking powder
1/2 tsp baking soda
2 tsp diamond crystal or 1 1/4 tsp kosher salt
1 1/2 c buttermilk, divided
4 tbsp unsalted butter, melted, divided + more for serving
1 c fresh blueberries
1 tbsp vegetable oil

Preheat oven to 375F. Whisk flour and cornmeal in a small bowl. Whisk eggs, sugar, baking powder, salt, and baking soda in a medium bowl until eggs are lightened and smooth, ~30 s. Add 3/4 c buttermilk and half of dry ingredients and whisk very gently just to barely combine. Adding the dry ingredients in two batches, rather than all at once. Using a wooden spoon, fold in blueberries. Heat oil and 2 tbsp melted butter in a large oven safe nonstick skillet (min 8" diameter) over medium high. When foaming subsides, scrape in batter and use the back of a spoon to gently nudge it all the way to the edges. Reduce heat to medium and cook, shaking pan back and forth occasionally to ensure pancake will eventually slide out freely, until bubbles appear across surface of pancake, 5-6 min. Transfer pan to oven and cook until pancake is puffed and set, 10-12 min. Invert pancake onto a large plate or platter. Cut into wedges and serve with room temp butter and maple syrup.


Notes: Can sub fresh berries (blackberries, raspberries, etc) for blueberries.
