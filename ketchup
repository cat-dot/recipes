Tomato Ketchup

4 pints ripe grape tomatoes, cut in half (plum tomatoes work as well)
2 c red wine vinegar
2/3 c dark brown sugar
4 tsp salt
2 tsp black pepper
3/4 tsp worcestershire sauce

In a wide skillet, simmer tomatoes, vinegar, sugar, salt, and pepper until a thick, jamlike mixture forms and liquid evaporates, 20-25 min. Puree until smooth. Strain through a fine mesh sieve. Stir in worcestershire. Chill before serving.
