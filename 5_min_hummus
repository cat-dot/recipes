5 Minute Hummus
  --Michael Solomov

Tehina Sauce:
1 garlic clove
juice of 1 lemon
16 oz jar tehina (tahini)
1 tbsp kosher salt
1 tsp ground cumin
1-1 1/2 c ice water

Nick off a pice of the garlic (~1/4 of clove) and drop into food processor. Squeeze the lemon juice into the food processor. Pour tehina on top, making sure to scrape it all out of the container, and add the salt and cumin. Process until the mixture looks peanut buttery, ~1 min. Stream in the ice water, a little at a time, with the motor running. Process just until the mixture is smooth and creamy and lightens to the color of dry sand. 

Hummus:
15 oz can chickpeas, drained and rinsed

Add the chickpeas to the tenina sauce and process for ~3 min, scraping the sides of the bowl as you go, until the chickpeas are completely blended and the hummus is smooth and uniform in color.
