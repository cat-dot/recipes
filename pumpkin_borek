  --America's Test Kitchen

Filling:
1 tbsp evoo 
1 large onion, chopped
1 1/2 tsp salt
3 garlic cloves, minced
1 tsp grated fresh ginger
1/2 tsp pepper
1 1/2 c dry white wine
3x15 oz cans unsweetened pumpkin puree
5 large eggs
12 oz halloumi cheese, grated (3 c)
8 oz (1 c) cottage cheese
1/2 c chopped fresh mint

Heat oil in 10" skillet over medium-high heat until shimmering. Add onion and salt and cook until softened, ~5 min. Stir in garlic, ginger, and pepper and cook until fragrant, ~30 s. Stir in wine, bring to simmer, and cook, stirring occasionally, until onion is very tender and mixture has reduced slightly and measures 1 1/4 c, 15-20 min. Transfer onion mixture to food processor and let cool slightly. Add pumpkin and eggs and process until mixture is thoroughly combined and smooth, ~3 min, scraping down sides of bowl as needed. Combine halloumi, cottage cheese, and mint in separate bowl. 

Assembly:
1/3 c whole milk
1 large egg
2 lb (14x9") phyllo, thawed

Adjust oven rack to middle position and heat oven to 400F. Whisk milk and egg together in bowl until combined. Trim 50 phyllo sheets to 12 1/2 x 8 1/2". Spread 1 c pumpkin filling on bottom of greased 13x9" baking dish. Lay 5 phyllo sheets in dish, brush with egg mixture, then top with 5 more phyllo sheets. Brush phyllo with egg mixture, then spread 2 1/3 c pumpkin filling evenly on top. Lay 5 more phyllo sheets in dish, brush with egg mixture, then top with 5 more phyllo sheets. Brush phyllo with egg mixture, then spread half of cheese mixture evenly on top. Lay 5 more phyllo sheets in dish, brush with egg mixture, then top with 5 more phyllo sheets. Working from center outward, use palms of your hands to gently compress layers and press out any air pockets. Repeat layering, then brush top with egg mixture. Trim 10 phyllo sheets to 13x9". Spread remaining pumpkin filling evenly on phyllo layers. Lay 5 large phyllo sheets in dish, brush with egg mixture, then top with 5 more large phyllo sheets. Gently compress layers and wipe away excess filling that may have leaked out along sides of dish. Brush top with egg mixture and bake until borek registers 165F and top is puffed and golden brown, 40-45 min. Let cool for 30 min before serving.



Notes: Phyllo dough is also available in larger 18x14" sheets; if using, cut them in half to make 14x9" sheets. Do not thaw the phyllo in the microwave; let it sit in the refrigerator overnight or on the counter for 4-5 hr. While working with the phyllo, cover the sheets with plastic wrap, then a damp dish towel to prevent drying.
