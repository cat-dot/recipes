  --America's Test Kitchen

3 tbsp vegetable oil
2 onions, chopped fine
salt and pepper
4 tsp curry powder
1 1/2 tsp garam masala
3 garlic clove, minced
1 serrano chile, stemmed, seeded, and minced
1 tbsp grated fresh ginger
1 tbsp tomato paste
2 c chicken or vegetable broth + extra as needed
1/2 head cauliflower (1 lb), cored and cut into 1" florets
12 oz sweet potatoes, peeled and cut into 3/4" pieces
15 oz can chickpeas, rinsed
14.5 oz can diced tomatoes
8 oz green beans, trimmed and cut into 1" lengths
1/2 c canned coconut milk
1/3 c minced fresh cilantro

Using highest sauté or browning function, heat oil in multicooker until shimmering. Add onions and tsp salt and cook until onions are softened, 3-5 min. Stir in curry powder, garam masala, garlic, serrano, ginger, and tomato paste and cook until fragrant, ~1 min. Stir in broth, scraping up any browned bits, then stir in cauliflower, potatoes, chickpeas, and tomatoes and their juice. 
TO PRESSURE COOK: Lock lid in place and close pressure release valve. Select high pressure cook function and cook for 2 min. Turn off multicooker and quick-release pressure. Carefully remove lid, allowing steam to escape away from you.
TO SLOW COOK: Lock lid in place and open pressure release valve. Select low slow cook function and cook until vegetables are tender, 4-5 hr. (If using Instant Pot, select high slow cook function and increase cooking range to 6-7 hr.) Carefully remove lid, allowing steam to escape away from you.
Gently stir green beans into curry and cook using highest sauté or browning function until crisp-tender, 6-8 min. Turn off multicooker. Stir in coconut milk and adjust consistency with extra hot broth as needed. Stir in cilantro and season with salt and pepper to taste. Serve.
