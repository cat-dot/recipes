S'mores Pie

Crust:
2 c graham cracker crumbs
6 tbsp unsalted butter, melted and cooled
1 tsp kosher salt

Preheat oven to 350. In a medium bowl, mix all ingredients together until incorporated and resembling wet sand. Transfer to a 9" pie dish and press the crumbs firmly on the bottom and up the sides of the dish. Bake until lightly golden, 15-20 min. Let cool completely.

Ganache:
3 c semisweet chocolate chips
1 1/2 tsp kosher salt
1 1/2 c heavy cream

In a medium bowl, combine the chocolate chips and salt. In a small saucepan, bring the cream to a simmer over medium heat. As soon as it begins to simmer, pour the cream over the chocolate chips. Let sit for 2 min, then stir until smooth. Pour into the cooled pie shell and let cool completely.

Toffee:
6 tbsp unsalted butter + more for greasing
1/2 c sugar
1 tbsp amaretto
2 tsp light corn syrup
1 tsp kosher salt

Line a baking sheet with parchment paper and set aside. In a 4 quart saucepan, add all the ingredients over medium heat. Cook until amber in color, 9-10 min. Pour onto the prepared baking sheet and cool. Using a mallet, break the toffee into small pieces and sprinkle over the chocolate layer.

Marshmallow
1 tbsp powdered gelatin
1/2 c water, divided
1/2 tsp kosher salt
1 egg white
1 c sugar
1 tbsp light corn syrup
1/2 tsp vanilla 

Sprinkle the gelatin over 1/4 c water to bloom, 5 min. Using an electric hand mixer, beat the salt and egg white until stiff peaks form. Meanwhile, in a 4 quart saucepan, heat the remaining ingredients over medium heat until a candy thermometer reaches 245F, 5-7 min. Stir the bloomed gelatin into the syrup until dissolved. With the motor running, slowly stream the syrup down the side of the bowl into the egg whites. Continue beating the egg whites on high speed until glossy and cool to the touch, 10-15 min. Spread the marshmallow into the pie dish in an even layer and refrigerate for 4 hrs. Torch the pie until golden, then slice and serve.
