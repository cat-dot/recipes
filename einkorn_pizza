In a large bowl, mix together the water, yeast, and 1 c (120 g) of flour. Let stand for 15 min. Add the remaining 4 c (408 g) of flour and the salt and mix together as much as you can with a stiff spatula. Add the oil and begin kneading the dough in the bowl until it holds together. Lightly flour a work surface and turn out the dough and knead for 2-3 min. Place the dough back in the bowl and cover tightly with plastic wrap. Let rest for 2 hrs at room temp. Lightly grease a baking sheet with oil. Divide the dough into 4 pieces. Roll each piece into a tight ball and place on the prepared baking sheet. Cover the dough with a lightly oiled plastic wrap. Let rest 15 min. Place 2 baking sheets or a pizza stone in the oven. Preheat the oven to 500F for 30 min. Heavily dust a piece of parchment paper with flour and roll out a piece of dough to an 8" round. Slide the dough onto the preheated baking sheet or stone. Add toppings. Bake the pizzas for 10-12 min until the edges are dark brown and the cheese just begins to brown. Serve immediately.
