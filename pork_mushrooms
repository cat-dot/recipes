1 piece trimmed boneless pork loin, 1.5lbs cut evenly into 8 slices
evoo or avocado oil
10 oz cremini mushrooms, thickly sliced
sea salt and freshly ground black pepper
1/4 c flour
1/4 c finely chopped shallots
1/3 c dry white wine
1.5 c chicken broth

Pound pork slices to ~ 1/3" thick with a meat pounder. Set aside. In a large heavy skillet over medium high heat, add 1.5 tbsp oil and the mushrooms and cook, stirring occasionally until nicely browned, ~ 6 min. Transfer mushrooms to a bowl. Return the skillet to the heat. Season half the pork with salt and pepper and dust on both sides with flour, shaking off any ecxcess. Add 2 tbsp oil to the pan and add 3-4 slices of pork to the skillet, without crowding. Cook about 2 min until golden brown underneath; turn and cook 2 min more. Transfer pork to a plate and repeat with remaining pork until all is cooked. Add the shallot to the skillet, with a little more oil if needed; cook stirring 1-2 min more to soften. Pour in the wine and simmer until nearly dry. Add the broth and bring to a simmer. Return the pork to the pan, all at once with any accumulated juices, and cook 1-2 min, turning to heat through. Transfer pork to a platter, cover loosely with foil to keep warm and erturn cooked mushrooms to the skillet with 1/2 the rosemary. Simmer 1 min, then stir in the butter. Season with salt and pepper, then spoon the sauce over the pork and garnish with remaining rosemary.
