Whisk flour, baking powder, baking soda, cinnamon, nutmeg, ginger, cloves, and salt together in a medium bowl; set aside. In a large bowl, add the oil, sugar, brown sugar, eggs, pumpkin, and vanilla. Whisk together until well combined. Add the dry ingredients to the wet, and stir until just combined. Spoon the batter into the prepared pans (or pipe), filling ~3/4 of the way. Bake for 12-15 min, until a toothpick inserted comes out clean. Remove from oven and cool for ~10 min before loosening the edges and removing to a wire rack to cool.

1/4 tsp salt
1 1/2 c powdered sugar

Sift sugar into a bowl. Add syrup, milk, and salt andwhisk to combine. Add additional milk if needed to thin. 

Coating:
1/2 c sugar
1 tsp cinnamon
1 stick (8 tbsp) unsalted butter, cut into 8 even pieces

Melt butter in small saucepan over medium heat. Stir frequently to prevent burning. The butter will turn golden and brownish specks will appear. Remove pan from heat and carefully pour butter into a heat proof fowl. Set aside to cool a bit. In a small shallow bowl, whisk sugar and cinnamon. 

Dip donuts into glaze and return to rack to let excess drip off. Or, dip into browned butter and then dip into cinnamon sugar.
