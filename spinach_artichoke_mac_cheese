Spinach and Artichoke Mac and Cheese
  --Cook's Country

1 tbsp evoo
3 garlic cloves, minced
5 oz (5 c) baby spinach, chopped coarse
1 1/2 c water
1 c whole milk
8 oz (2 c) elbow macaroni
1/4 tsp table salt
1 c marinated artichoke hearts, chopped
4 oz American cheese, shredded (1 c)
1/2 tsp pepper
4 oz extra-sharp cheddar cheese, shredded (1 c)
1 1/2 oz Parmesan cheese, shredded (1/2 c)

Heat oil in large saucepan over medium-high heat until shimmering. Add garlic and cook until fragrant, ~30 s. Add spinach and cook until wilted, 2-3 min. Transfer spinach to bowl and set aside. Bring water and milk to boil in now-empty saucepan over high heat. Stir in macaroni and salt and reduce heat to medium-low. Cook, stirring frequently, until macaroni is slightly past al dente, 6-8 min. Add artichokes, American cheese, and pepper and cook, stirring constantly, until cheese is completely melted, ~1 min. Off heat, stir in cheddar and Parmesan until evenly distributed but not melted. Cover saucepan and let stand for 5 min. Add spinach to macaroni and stir until sauce is smooth (sauce may look loose but will thicken as it cools). Season with salt and pepper to taste. Serve.


Notes: Use a 4 oz block of American cheese from the deli counter rather than presliced cheese.
