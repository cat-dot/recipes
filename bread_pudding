Bread Pudding
  --Ree Drummond
  
2 eggs
2 tbsp melted butter
2 tbsp vanilla
2 1/2 c milk
2 c sugar
3 1/2 to 5 c sourdough bread, cut into 1" cubes
1/3 c pecans, chopped finely

Preheat oven to 325 F. Beat together eggs, butter, vanilla, and milk. Add sugar and mix until sugar is dissoved. Arrange bread cubes tightly in a 9" baking dish, keeping the crust facing up around the edges in scattered within the dish. Pour liquid over the bread. Sprinkle pecans all over and bake for 55-70 min, or until crust is golden brown all over the top.


Whiskey Cream Sauce:
1/2 c sugar
1 stick butter
1/2 c cream
1/4 c Jack Daniels

Combine all ingredients in a saucepan. Stir constantly over low heat until mixture reaches a low boil. Pour a small amount over the individual servings of bread pudding.


Notes: If not using sourdough, reduce sugar. I used ~1 c pecans, but they are optional if you don't like nuts. Didn't try sauce yet.
