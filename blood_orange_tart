Blood Orange Tart with Chocoalte Crust
Cindy Pawlcyn, Napa Valley, CA

Crust:
11" fluted tart pan with a removable bottom
1 c plus 2 tbsp ap flour
1/4 c cocoa powder
1/2 c powdered sugar
pinch of salt
10 tbsp unsalted butter at room temperature
1/4 tsp vanilla
1 tsp orange zest

Combine the flour, cocoa powder, powdered sugar, butter, and salt in a bowl of a stand mixer with paddle. Mix on speeds 1-2 until the mixture comes together. Add the vanilla and orange zest. Press the dough evenly into the tart pan and the fluted edges. Chill until firm. Preheat oven to 375F. Line the pan with foil and bake for 15 min. If the dough puffs, press it back down with spatula or spoon. Let cool.

Curd:
1 tbsp finely grated blood orange zest
1 c freshly squeezed blood orange juice
3 tbsp freshly squeezed Meyer lemon juice
12 tbsp unsalted butter - diced, at room temperature
1/2 c sugar
4 eggs
4 egg yolks

Combine the juices, zest, and reserve. Whisk the yolks, whole eggs and sugar in a non-reactive bowl that will sit over a pot of simmering water to create a bain marie or double boiler. Continue to whisk the mixture over simmering water until thick and lighter in color. Add 1/3 of the fruit juice. Whisk until it begins to thicken then add the remaining 2/3 juice continuing to whisk constantly. The curd must be quite thick and have absorbed all of the foam and the whisk will leave a trail at the bottom of the bowl. Off the heat whisk in the butter until blended. Pour into the baked crust or chill the curd in the refrigerator and finish the tart the following day. The curd holds overnight covered, then fill the crust several hours before serving.

Crème Fraîche:
1 c crème fraîche
1 tsp lemon zest
3 tbsp sugar

Combine all ingredients and whip until light and fluffy. Spread over tart before serving.
