Goat Cheese and Citrus Cheesecake
  --Recipe developed for Sur La Table’s Cooking Classes

2 c finely ground graham cracker crumbs
1/2 c unsalted butter, melted
11 oz fresh, mild goat cheese
2/3 c  sugar
15 oz container whole milk ricotta
2 large eggs
2 large egg yolks
1 tsp vanilla 
1 tsp orange zest
1 tsp lemon zest
2 tbsp honey

Preheat the oven to 325F and position an oven rack in the center. Lightly coat a 9" or 10" spring-form pan with butter or cooking spray. Place the crumbs and melted butter in a medium bowl and stir with a fork to moisten the crumbs evenly. With a silicone spatula, scrape the crumbs into the prepared pan. Press the crumbs in an even layer across the bottom of the pan, working outward from the center. Bake the crust for 8-10 min until set and lightly browned. Transfer to a rack to cool, leaving the oven on. Place the goat cheese and sugar in the bowl of the food processor and process until smooth and creamy, about 1 minute. Scrape down the bowl once with the spatula. Add the ricotta cheese and process until incorporated and smooth, ~20-30 s, scraping down the bowl halfway through. Be sure there are no lumps left (you won’t be able to smooth them out later). Add the eggs, egg yolks, vanilla and orange and lemon zests and process until well blended, about 20 seconds. Scrape the mixture into the cooled crust. Set the cheesecake pan on the baking sheet (in case of leakage). Bake for 35-45 min, until the edge is set but the center still has a 1" wide pool of liquid batter (it will firm up during cooling and chilling). Transfer the cheesecake to a cooling rack and immediately run a thin, flexible knife or spatula around the edge the cake, gently pressing into the side of the pan to avoid gouging the cake from the side of the pan and prevent cracking as it cools. Let the cheesecake cool completely, 1-2 hr. When cool, cover with plastic wrap and chill for at least 4 hr prior to serving.
