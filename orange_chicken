Orange Chicken
  --Adam Ragusea

2 crowns of broccoli, cut into florets
water (for steaming and shocking broccoli)
1 lb boneless, skinless chicken thighs, cut into large chunks
salt, to taste
cornstarch, for coating chicken
avocado oil (or any high-heat oil)
3 cloves garlic, minced
1" piece ginger, minced
zest of 1 orange
juice of 1 large orange (or 2 smaller ones)
shoyu, to taste (~1/4 c)
rice vinegar, to taste (~2 tbsp)
1/4 c granulated sugar
red chili flakes, to taste

Heat a 12" pan over medium-high heat. Add a film of water and the broccoli florets. Cover (loosely) and steam for ~5 minu until just fork-tender. Remove the broccoli and transfer to a bowl. Shock with cold running water to stop cooking and set aside. Season the chicken chunks with salt. Coat the chicken pieces with cornstarch until they are not wet or sticky. Heat the pan again with a generous film of avocado oil. Add the chicken pieces to the pan, making sure not to overcrowd. Let them form a crust before nudging to prevent sticking. Stir-fry until golden and crispy. While the chicken is cooking, mince the garlic and ginger. Zest the orange and set aside. Once the chicken is cooked, add the minced garlic and ginger. Stir-fry for ~1 min. Deglaze the pan with shoyu, rice vinegar, and orange juice. Add the sugar and stir well. Return the broccoli to the pan and stir to combine. The moisture from the broccoli will help prevent the sauce from burning. Adjust seasoning with more soy sauce and vinegar if needed. Scatter a bit of cornstarch over the dish and stir aggressively to thicken the sauce. Add red chili flakes and orange zest, then turn off the heat. Give the dish a final stir off heat up to prevent the zest from becoming bitter. Serve hot and enjoy!
