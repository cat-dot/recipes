Roasted Cauliflower Lettuce Wraps w/ Korean BBQ Sauce
  --Lindsay, pinch of yum

Sauce:
1/2 c shoyu
1/4 c brown sugar
1 clove garlic
1" knob fresh ginger
1 tbsp rice vinegar
1 tbsp sambal oelek (or a spicy chile paste, or sriracha – use less for a milder sauce)
1 tbsp toasted sesame oil
1/2 tbsp cornstarch

Blend everything in a food processor or blender until smooth. Simmer in a saucepan over low heat until it thickens slightly. 
Wraps:
6–8 c small cauliflower florets (1 large or 2 small heads)
2 tbsp olive oil
1/2 tsp salt
butter lettuce cups (6-8 large leaves)
1/4 c crushed peanuts
2 tbsp minced chives
spicy mayo (1/4 c mayo with a 1 tsp of sriracha)

Preheat the oven to 450F. Toss the cauliflower with a drizzle of oil and a pinch of salt. Roast for 30 min. Pour sauce directly onto the roasting pan – just enough to get the cauliflower nice and saucy. Toss gently to combine. Arrange the sauced up cauliflower in lettuce cups. Top with extra sauce, crushed peanuts, chives, and a drizzle of spicy mayo. 


Notes: Spicy mayo: mix about 1/4 cup mayo with a squirt of sriracha! Thin it out as necessary,
