Thai Smashed Cucumber Salad

6 small persian or japanese cucumbers (1lb) ends trimmed
2 garlic cloves, grated using a microplane
2 tbsp rice wine vinegar
2 tbsp sugar
1 tbsp chile oil
1 tbsp toasted sesame oil
1 tbsp fish sauce (optional)
2 1/2 tsp kosher salt (to taste)
1 tsp finely grated ginger (1-2")
2 tsp finely grated lime zest
2 tbsp fresh lime juice
1/4 c chopped cilantro
2 scallions, halved lengthwise and thinly sliced on an angle

Cut the cucumbers into 1" rings and arrange them on a cutting board. Using a large knife, gently smash down on the pieces so that they flatten out a bit. In a large bowl, combine the garlic, vinegar, sugar, chile oil, fish sauce, salt, and ginger. Add the cucumbers and toss. Refrigerate for at least 20 min, overnight better. Right before serving, toss in lime zest and juice, cilantro, and scallions.
