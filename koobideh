1 medium yellow onion
1 lb ground beef or lamb, 80/20
1 tbsp lemon juice, divided
1 tsp salt plus more to taste
1/2 tsp pepper plus more to taste
1 tbsp oil flavorless, like canola, vegetable, avocado, etc. divided
1/2 tsp saffron ground and bloomed in 1 tbsp hot water

Grate the onion and squeeze out all the liquid, reserving the liquid. Add the ground meat, 2 tsp lemon juice, 1 tsp of oil, the steeped saffron, salt, and pepper. Knead for a minimum of 5 min, but preferably 10 min until it is very sticky. Refrigerate for a minimum of 30 min, but preferably 1 hr. Mix together 2 tsp of oil, 1 teaspoon of lemon juice, and 1 tbsp of the onion juice. This is for basting. Mix together the rest of the onion juice and some ice water. Skewer with cold, wet hands. It is helpful to taper the bottom and top of the kabob of each skewer. Use your pointer and middle finger in a scissor position press the classic indentations along the kabob. Cook over high heat flipping every 30 s until cooked through, 8-10 min. Base with the basting liquid when you have ~1 min left.


Notes: Make sure you have squeezed all the water out of the onion. Too much liquid will make the meat mixture not sticky enough. Too much onion will also keep it from sticking, so stay with the ratio in the recipe. If meat is still falling off the skewer, you can add 1/2 tsp of baking soda to help it stick on the skewer. Only use this if absolutely necessary, because this will change the texture of the final kabob to a slightly rubbery one.
