Split Pea Soup

1 lb (2 1/4c) green split peas
1 large onion, peeled and chopped
2 celery stalks, chopped
1 large leek, chopped
1 large carrot, chopped
1 large clove of garlic, halved
1 herb bouquet (tie 3 cloves garlic, 4 allspice berrits, 2 bay leaves, 1 tsp thyme, 8 sprigs parsely in rinsed cheesecloth or place in bouquet garni bag)
2 well rinsed ham hocks
salt and pepper

Pick over peas and remove any stones. Wash and drain peas. Place in a 4 quart pan with the vegetables, bouquet, ham hocks and 2 1/2quarts water. Bring to a simmer. Skim the scum off the top of the soup for several minutes, until the scum cease to rise. Cover loosely and simmer about 1 1/2 hrs, or until the peas are tender, stirring occasionally in case they stick to the bottom. Remove the ham hocks and bouquet from the soup. Puree with a blender/immersion blender. If you want an exceptionally smooth soup, pass the puree through a sieve. Return to the pot and heat to serve. Add salt and pepper to taste.
