Tres Leches Cake

1 c ap flour
1 1/2 tsp baking powder
1/4 tsp salt
5 whole eggs
1 c sugar, divided
1 tsp vanilla
1/3 c milk
1 can evaporated milk
1 can sweetened, condensed milk
1/4 c heavy cream

Preheat oven to 350F. Spray a 9x13" pan liberally until coated. Combine flour, baking powder, and salt in a large bowl. Separate eggs. Beat egg yolks with 3/4 c sugar on high speed until yolks are pale yellow. Stir in milk and vanilla. Pour egg yolk mixture over flour mixture and stir very gently until combined. Beat egg whites on high speed until soft peaks for. With the mixer on, pour in remaining 1/4 c of sugar and beat until egg whites are stiff but not dry. Fold egg whites into the batter very gently until just combined. Pour into prepared pan and spread to even out the surface. Bake for 35-45 min until a toothpick comes out clean. Turn cake out onto a rimmed platter and allow to cool. Combine condensed milk, evaporated milk, and heavy cream in a small pitcher. When cake is cool, pierce the surface with a fork several times. Slowly drizzle all but ~1 c of the milk mixture - try to get as much around the edges as you can. Allow the cake to absorb the milk for 30 min. 


Icing:
1 pint heavy cream
3 tbsp sugar

Whip ingredients together until thick and spreadable. Spread over the surface of the cake and serve. Traditional has maraschino cherries, either whole or chopped up.

Notes: From other recipes, the direction is to pour the milk over the cake when it is warm, not hot, not cold, and let it soak overnight. Some even say to flip it before spreading whipped cream and serving.
