Nam Prik Pao
  --Leela, SheSimmers

34g deseeded dried red chilies (Thai long peppers or arbol chilies) â€“ weigh the chilies after they have been stemmed and deseeded. (The amount of seeds you add back into the paste when you grind it determines the level of heat)
64g peeled garlic cloves
84g peeled shallots
20g Thai shrimp paste
190g palm sugar, chopped into small pieces
24g dried shrimp
4 tbsp tamarind paste
4 tbsp fish sauce
1 c water
1/2 c vegetable oil + more for frying

Cut the garlic cloves and shallots lengthwise into uniformly thin slices. Separate the two. Spread them out on 2 cookie sheets to dry a little. Heat up 1/2-3/4 c oil in 8-12" frying pan over medium heat. Fry the garlic and shallot slices, separately, until light brown and crisp; set aside. Do the same with the dried shrimp; set aside. In a dry skillet over medium-low heat, toast the dried chilies until they have changed their texture from somewhat rubbery to somewhat brittle. Be careful not to burn them. In a granite mortar or food processor, pound or grind all the garlic, shallots, dried shrimp, and dried chilies into a fine paste; set aside. Put the paste and the remaining ingredients, including the 1/2 c oil, in a shallow and wide pan set over medium heat. Cook everything, stirring occasionally, for ~15 min until everything has dissolved and you get a fried paste that is thinner than commercial Nam Prik Pao. Remove the pan from heat and let the mixture cool completely. Check for consistency. If the paste is still too thin, reduce it some more over medium heat. When you have achieved the desired consistency, store your Nam Prik Pao in a clean glass jar. No need to drain off the oil.


Notes: preparing tamarind pulp - 1 oz shelled tamarinds per 1 fluid oz water, squish/squeeze with hands, keep paste, throw out veins, seeds, etc. if making a large batch, freeze unused as won't last too long in refrigerator
