Place bulgur in a heat safe bowl or pot; pour boiling water over and let stand for 1 hr. (1/2 c dry == 1 c presoaked). While it soaks, wash and dry produce. Finely chop parsley, stalks included. Pick the mint leaves  of the stems, finely chop the leaves, discarding the stems. Mince scallions, both white and green parts. Medium dice cucumber and tomato; cut lemons in half. In a large bowl, combine the parsley, mint, and scallions. If preparing this in advance, stop and store ingredients in refrigerator. Gently mix in the bulgur, cucumber, and tomato; season with salt and pepper to taste. Add lemon juice to taste and toss. Chill for 1 hr to blend the flavors. Just prior to serving, toss with olive oil.
