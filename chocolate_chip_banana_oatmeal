2 flax eggs (2 tbsp flax meal + 5 tbsp water) 
1/2 c mashed ripe banana + more sliced for topping
2 tbsp maple syrup (can sub other syrup)
2 tbsp melted coconut oil or avocado oil (can sub applesauce)
1/4 tsp salt
1/2 tsp cinnamon
2 c dairy free milk

3/4 c chopped walnuts or pecans (use nut of choice)
1/3 c gf dark chocolate chips
1-2 tbsp coconut sugar (optional)
2-3 tbsp nut butter (optional)

Preheat oven to 350F/176C and grease a 2 qt baking dish with oil or line with parchment paper. Prepare flax eggs in a large mixing bowl. Then add banana, maple syrup, oil, salt, and cinnamon and whisk to combine. Add milk and whisk once more. Then add oats, nuts, and half the chcocolate chips and stir to combine. Transfer mixture to prepared dish and top with additional banana slices, nuts (optional), and remaining chocolate chips. Sprinkle with coconut sugar (if using) and drizzle with a little nut butter (if using). Bake for 30-35 min or until the top is golden brown, the edges are slightly caramelized, and it has some springiness in the center. Let cool for a few minutes. Serve warm with desired toppings, such as warmed milk and a drizzle of syrup or additional nut butter. Store leftovers covered in refrigerator 3-4 days, or in freezer for up to 1 month. Reheat in 350F oven or in the microwave until hot, adding additional milk as needed to moisten.
