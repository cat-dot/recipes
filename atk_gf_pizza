Gluten-Free Pizza
  --America's Test Kitchen

Crust:
16 oz (3 1/2 c + 1/4 c) ATK ap gf flour
2 1/2 oz (1/2 c + 1 tbsp) almond flour
1 1/2 tbsp powdered psyllium husk
2 1/2 tsp baking powder
2 tsp salt
1 tsp instant or rapid rise yeast
2 1/2 c warm water (100F)
1/4 c vegetable oil
vegetable oil spray

Using a stand mixer fitted with paddle, mix flour blend, almond flour, psyllium, baking powder, salt, and yeast on low speed until combined. Slowly add warm water and oil in steady stream until incorporated. Increase speed to medium and beat until dough is sticky and uniform, ~6 min. Dough will resemble thick batter. Remove bowl from mixer, cover with plastic wrap, and let stand until inside of dough is bubbly, ~1 1/2 hrs. Dough will puff slightly but will not rise. Adjust oven racks to middle and lower positions. Line 2 rimmed baking sheets with parchment paper and spray liberally with oil spray. Transfer half of dough to center of 1 sheet. Using oil sprayed rubber spatula, spread dough into 8" circle. Spray top of dough with oil spray, cover with large sheet of plastic, and using your hands, press out dough to 11 1/2" round, ~1/4" thick, leaving outer 1/4" slightly thicker than center; discard plastic. Repeat with remaining dough. Place in oven and heat oven to 325F. Bake dough until firm to touch, golden brown on underside, and just beginning to brown on top, 45-50 min, switching and rotating sheets halfway through baking. Transfer to wire rack and let cool.

Sauce:
28 oz can whole peeled tomatoes, drained
1 tbsp evoo
1 tsp red wine vinegar
1 garlic clove, minced
1 tsp dried oregano
1/2 tsp salt
1/4 tsp pepper

Process all ingredients in food processor until smooth, ~30 s. Transfer to bowl and refrigerate until ready to use.

Cheese:
1 oz parmesan cheese, grated fine (1/2 c)
8 oz whole milk mozzarella cheese, shredded (2 c)

One hour before baking pizza, adjust oven rack to upper middle position, set baking stone on rack, and heat oven to 500F. Transfer 1 crust to pizza peel. Using back of spoon or ladle, spread 1/2 c sauce in thin layer over surface, leaving 1/4" border around edge. Sprinkle 1/4 c parmesan evenly over sauce, followed by 1 c mozzarella. Carefully slide crust onto stone and bake until crust is well browned and cheese is bubbly and beginning to brown, 10-12 min. Transfer pizza to wire rack and let cool for 5 min before slicing and serving. Repeat with second crust, 1/2 c sauce, and remaining cheeses. 


Notes: Extra sauce can refrigerated for up to 1 week or frozen for up to 1 month. Parbaked and cooled crusts can sit at room temp for up to 4 hrs. Completely cooled crusts can be wrapped with plastic and foil and frozen for up to 2 weeks. Frozen crusts can be topped and baked without thawing. If you don't have almond flour, can process 2 1/2 oz blanched almonds in a food processor until finely ground, ~30 s. Can substitue 16 oz (2 2/3 c +1/4 c) King Arthur GF Multi-Purpose Flour or 16 oz (2 2/3 c + 1/2 c) Bob's Red Mill GF AP Baking Flour for ATK GF AP Flour.
