Gluten Free, Grain Free, Cheesy Garlic Cauliflower Bread Sticks

1 c cooked cauliflower
1/2 c shredded mozarella cheese
1/2 c parmesean cheese
1 egg, beaten
1 tsp dried oregano
1/2 tsp crushed garlic
1/2 tsp garlic salt
olive oil

topping:
2 cloves finely minced garlic
1/4 c grated parmesean cheese
1/4 c grated mozarella cheese

Preheat oven to 450F. Chop the cauliflower florets into chunks and steam until slightly soft, about 15 min. Place in a ricer or grate until a rice like consistency is achieved. One large head should produce ~ 3 c of riced cauliflower. 
To make the bread: Prepare your baking sheet (parchment paper + olive oil) In a medium bowl, stir together 1 c cauliflower, egg, parmesean and mozarella. Add oregano, crushed garlic, and garlic salt; stir.
Transfer to the baking sheet; using your hands, pat out into a large rectangle. Bake for 15 min. Remove from oven. Spread minced garlic & top with grated parmesean and mozarella cheeses. Place back in the oven until all the cheese is melted.
Slice and serve
