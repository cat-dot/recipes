Käsespätzle 
  --@TornadosBadNauheim

Spätzle:
2 c (250g) ap flour
4 eggs
1/2 c (120ml) water (or as needed)
salt (to taste)
nutmeg (optional, to taste)

In a large bowl, mix the flour, eggs, a pinch of salt, and nutmeg (if using). Gradually add water until the dough is smooth but still thick. Let it rest for ~15-30 min. Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil. Using a spätzle maker or a colander with large holes, press the dough through the holes directly into the boiling water. You can also cut small pieces and drop them into the water if you don't have a spätzle maker. Once the spätzle floats to the top, let it cook for another 2-3 min, then remove it with a slotted spoon and drain. Repeat until all the dough is used.

Käsespätzle:
1 1/2 c (150g) grated Emmental, Gruyère, or another similar cheese
1 large onion, thinly sliced
2 tbsp butter
salt and pepper (to taste)
fresh chives or parsley, chopped (for garnish)

While the spätzle cooks, melt the butter in a pan over medium heat and add the thinly sliced onions. Fry them until they are golden brown and crispy. Set aside. Preheat your oven to 350F (175C) In a separate pan or a baking dish, layer the cooked spätzle with the grated cheese. Begin with spätzle, add cheese, and repeat until all ingredients are used, finishing with a layer of cheese. Place the dish in the oven and bake for ~20 min or until the cheese is melted and bubbly. For a stove-top version, simply cook on low heat until the cheese melts, stirring gently. Top with the fried onions and parsley and serve.
