Gnocchi with Peas, Ramps, and Mushrooms

1 lbs russet potatoes
1 large egg yolk
1 tsp nutmeg
kosher salt to taste
1/2 c ap flour
4 tbsp butter, divided
4 oz shiitake mushrooms, diced
1/4 c fresh peas
4 stalks wild onions (like ramps) sliced diagonally
1/2 tsp chile flakes
1/2 c reserved pasta water
1 tbsp grated parmesan cheese
1 tarragon sprig, picked for garnish
zest of 1 lemon for garnish

Preheat oven to 425F. Bake potatoes for 1 hr, or until very tender. As soon as potatoes come out of oven, cut in half lengthwise and scoop out the potato, discarding the skin (or save for another use). Press potatoes through a ricer or a food mill, and spread out on a sheet tray while still hot. Let them cool to room temp. Transfer to a large mixing bowl. Mix in yolk, nutmeg, and pinch of salt. Gently mix in flour until dough comes together, being careful not to overmix. Test a piece in boiling water, boil for ~2 min. It should float for roughly 2 min. Then check for taste and structure; if it falls apart during boiling, it needs more flour. Divide dough into 4 pieces and roll into 1/2" diameter logs. Cut into 1" long pieces. Place on a sheet pan lined with parchment paper and flour; refrigerate until ready to cook. In a large saute pan over medium heat, add 2 tbsp butter. Once butter is bubbling, add mushrooms, peas, onions, and chile flakes. Saute lightly for ~2-3 min until tender. Add the pasta water to the pan and turn off. In a large pot of boiling water, add the gnocchi; once they float, continue to cook 2 more minutes. Once they are cooked, remove and add to the pan of vegetables. Bring to a simmer over medium heat and add the remaining 2 tbsp butter and parmesan cheese. Cook until glazed. Plate and top with tarragon and lemon zest, then serve.
