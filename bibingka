Bibingka (Filipino Coconut Rice Cake)

2 c (320g) rice flour
1/2 c (55g) glutinous rice flour
1 tbsp baking powder
1 tsp salt
3/4 c (150g) granulated sugar
1/3 c (76g) unsalted butter, melted + more melted butter for topping and butter for greasing the pan
1 1/2 c (355ml) coconut milk
3 eggs, lightly beaten
1 banana leaf (optional)
1 salted duck egg, sliced (optional)
1 c (80g) grated queso de bola or cheddar cheese
1/2 c (52g) grated coconut for topping (optional)

Heat oven to 350F. In a large bowl, whisk together the flours, baking powder, salt, and sugar. Make a well in the center and pour in melted butter, coconut milk, and eggs. Whisk mixture until smooth. Wash and dry banana leaf, if using, and line a 9" cast iron skillet with it. One leaf should be enough, but if more are needed, make sure to overlap leaves so that there are no gaps. Butter the leaf, and trim edges leaving a 1-2" overhang. Alternatively, generously grease skillet with butter. Pour mixture into skillet and bake 15 min. Remove from oven and top with salted egg and cheese. Return skillet to oven until bibingka is golden and browned, and a toothpick inserted in center comes out clean, 20-25 min. Brush with more melted butter and sprinkle with coconut if desired.
