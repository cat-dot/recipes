Dan Dan Noodle Salad

  --Hetty Lui McKinnon

Dressing:
2 tbsp Chinese sesame paste or tahini
2 tbsp chile oil or chile crisp + more for serving
1 tbsp shoyu or tamari
2 tsp black or rice vinegar
2 tsp sugar
1 garlic clove, grated
2-3 tbsp unsweetened nondairy milk (such as soy or oat) or water

In a small bowl, whisk together the sesame paste, chile oil, shoyu, vinegar, sugar and garlic until a chunky paste forms. Add 2 tbsp of the milk and whisk, adding another tbsp if needed, until the dressing is smooth and pourable. The dressing should be the consistency of cream. (The dressing can be prepared up to 2 days ahead and stored in a sealed jar or airtight container in the fridge. It will thicken up, so add a splash or two of milk or water to loosen it up before adding to the noodles.)

Salad:
Sea salt
10 oz baby bok choy (about 4)
10 oz fresh or frozen ramen noodles
2 c/10 oz fresh or canned corn kernels (or thawed from frozen)
2 tbsp toasted white sesame seeds
2 scallions, thinly sliced

Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil. Separate the white and green parts of the baby bok choy. Slice the white parts into thick pieces. Place in a colander and rinse well to remove any dirt or sediments. Drain. Add the ramen to the boiling water and cook until al dente according to packet directions. ~1 1/2 min before the noodles are ready, add the white parts of the baby bok choy and the corn. Just before everything is ready, throw in the green bok choy leaves and blanch until they are wilted, ~20 s. Drain immediately and refresh under cold running water, then leave to drain again. Let cool while you make the dressing. In a large shallow bowl, place the ramen noodles, greens and corn. Add the dressing and toss to coat. Top with the sesame seeds, scallions and a few drops of chile oil. Taste and season with salt if needed. Serve at room temperature. 


Notes: can add tofu/mushrooms/etc.
