Roast Chicken with Crispy Chickpeas and Kale
 - Melissa Clark
 
4½-5 lb chicken, patted dry with paper towels
1 tbsp kosher salt + more to taste
1 tbsp freshly ground black pepper + more to taste
Small bunch mixed fresh herbs (such as rosemary, thyme and sage)
1 Meyer lemon, halved lengthwise
1½ c cooked chickpeas
2 tbsp olive oil
½ tsp sweet smoked paprika
½ tsp hot smoked paprika
6 c baby kale (or baby spinach)

Place the dry chicken on a sheet pan and season inside and out with salt and pepper. Refrigerate, uncovered, to let the seasoning sink in and the skin firm up for at least 1 hr up to overnight. Preheat oven to 450F. Stuff the cavity with the small bunch of herbs and truss the legs. Place in the oven and roast until the skin just begins to brown, 30 min. Bring a small saucepan of water to a boil. Slice one of the lemon halves lengthwise, then thinly slice crosswise to make small wedges. Add to the water and boil until softened to remove any bitterness, 1 min. Drain and transfer to a medium bowl. Add the chickpeas, olive oil, both paprikas and a large pinch of salt. Remove the chicken from the oven and baste with any juices that have begun to collect in the pan. Scatter the chickpea mixture around the chicken and return to the oven to cook until the chickpeas are crispy and the chicken is golden brown and has an internal temperature of 165F when insterted  into the thigh with an instant-read thermometer, 20-25 min more. Transfer the chicken to a cutting board to rest for 5 minutes before carving. Meanwhile, add the kale to the hot pan and toss with the chickpeas until wilted. Squeeze the remaining lemon half on top and season with salt and pepper.
