Lemon Zest Glazed Donuts

Dough:
1 c whole milk, warmed to 115F
1 tbsp sugar
2¼ tsp (¼ oz) active dry yeast
3½ c ap flour + more for dusting
1 tsp kosher salt
2 eggs +1 yolk, beaten
6 tbsp unsalted butter, softened + more for greasing
Vegetable oil, for frying

In the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with a dough hook attachment, mix together the milk, sugar and yeast. Let sit until the mixture is foamy, 15 min. Add the flour, salt, eggs and butter, and mix on medium speed until a smooth dough forms. Transfer the dough to a large greased bowl, cover with plastic wrap and proof for 1 hr. After the first proof, the dough should have doubled in size. Punch it down in the bowl, cover with plastic wrap and allow to proof again for 45 min. 

Glaze:
2 c confectioners' sugar
¼ c whole milk
½ tsp kosher salt
½ tsp lemon zest
1 vanilla bean, seeds scraped

In a medium bowl, whisk all of the glaze ingredients together until smooth. Cover with plastic and set aside until ready to glaze.

Heat 2" of oil in a 6 quart dutch oven to 350F. On a lightly floured surface, roll out the dough to a ½" thickness. Using a 3½"  ring cutter, punch out doughnuts, then, using a 1" ring cutter, punch out a hole in the center of each one. Reroll the scraps as needed to get 12 doughnuts. Line a baking sheet with a wire rack. Working in batches, fry the doughnuts, flipping once, until golden brown and puffed, 1-2 min per side. Transfer the cooked doughnuts to the prepared baking sheet to drain. While the doughnuts are still warm, dip each one in the glaze and return to the wire rack to let the glaze set for 5 min, then serve.
