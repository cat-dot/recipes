Thai Green Curry Paste

1/2 c (5" piece) peeled and chopped ginger
1/4 c (2 1/2" piece) peeled and chopped galangal
1/4 c (12) garlic cloves
1 tbsp palm sugar
1 tsp ground cumin
1 tsp ground coriander
4 kaffir lime leaves
3 lemongrass pieces, finely sliced
2 green thai chile peppers

In a food processor, add the ginger and galangal, then pulse to chop, stopping every few seconds to wipe down the edges of the bowl. Once the mixture is finely chopped, add the remaining ingredients and process until a smooth paste forms. Use immediately or store in a sealed container for 1 week or freeze for up to 6 months.
