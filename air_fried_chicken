1/2 c buttermilk
1/2 tsp dry mustard
1/2 tsp garlic powder
1/4 c ap flour
2 c (2 oz) cornflakes, finely crushed
1 1/2 tsp poultry seasoning
1/2 tsp paprika
1/8 tsp cayenne pepper

Lightly spray baseof air fryer basket with oil spray. Remove skin from chicken and trim any excess fat. Halve each breast crosswise, pat dry with paper towels, and season with salt and pepper. Whisk buttermilk, mustard, garlic powder, 1/2 tsp salt, and 1/4 tsp pepper together in medium bowl. Spread flour in shallow dish. Combine cornflakes, poultry seasoning, paprika, 1/4 tsp salt, and cayenne in second shallow dish. Working with 1 piece of chicken at a time, dredge in flour, dip in buttermilk, letting excess drip off, then coat with cornflake mixture, pressing  gently to adhere; transfer to large plate. Lightly spray chicken with oil spray. Arrange chicken pieces in prepared basket, spaced evenly apart. Place basket in air fryer and set temp to 400F. Cook until chicken is crisp and registers 160F, 16-24 min, flipping and rotating pieces halfway through cooking. Serve.


Notes: To crush the cornflakes, place them in a zipper lock bag and use a rolling pin or the bottom of a large skillet to break them into fine crumbs. To help remove the skin from the chicken, use a paper towel to grasp the skin. Can use a combination of 2x5 oz thighs and 2 5 oz drumsticks instead of the chicken breasts, be sure to cook to 175F, 20-25 min.
