Yakisoba:

4 spring onions, thinly sliced
large handful of bean sprouts
1 tbsp toasted and crushed sesame seeds, for garnish
shredded and pickled ginger (can sub fresh grated ginger into sauce)

Pour boiling water over rinsed dried shiitake, set aside for as long as you can. Cook noodles per package instructions, minus a few minutes. Run under cold water to stop the cooking and set aside. Slice softened mushrooms. Heat up wok on medium heat. Add oil and heat until shimmering and smoking. Add in broccoli and cabbage, be careful of spatters. Stir fry for 2 min on medium high heat. Next add in baby corn, peper, carrot, tofu, spring onion, and mushrooms. Stir fry for another minute. Push all veggies to the side and add in the sauce to the bottom of the wok. Allow the sauce to bubblefor 15-30 s and then add the noodles. Mix the noodles into the sauce. Then add sprouts and incorporate the veggies and tofu. Serve, topping with sesame seeds and pickled ginger.


Notes: Can sub the water from the shiitake for the mushroom soy. Can either buy anotire or grind up nori sheets yourself.
