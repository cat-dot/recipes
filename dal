Slow Cooker Red Lentil Dal

3 c red lentils (can use part yellow split peas or split mung beans or combo)
6 c water
28 oz can diced tomatoes
1 large onion, diced
4 garlic cloves, minced
2 tbsp fresh grated ginger
1 tbsp tumeric
3 green cardamom pods
1 bay leaf
2 tsp each: cumin seeds, mustard seeds, onion seeds, fenugreek seeds,
1 tsp fennel seeds
1 tsp sea salt
1/4 tsp freshly ground black pepper

Place lentils into a large bowl and cover with water. Let soak for a few minutes and swish to wash the lentils. Drain well and rinse. Place in a slow cooker and add the 6 c water. Add the diced tomatoes, onion, garlic, ginger, tumeric, cardamom pods, bay leaf, salt, and black pepper. Heat a small skillet over medium heat. Add all of the seeds to the pan. Shake the pan while on the heat. When they smell fragrant, remove from the heat and transfer to the slow cooker. Stir well to combine all ingredients. Place lid on slow cooker and let cook on high for 4-5 hrs or low for 8-10 hrs. Remove lid after cooking time and stir. Taste and if lentils are not soft, cook for another 30-60 min if needed. Add more salt and pepper if needed. To serve, ladle over brown rice and top with a squeeze of fresh lemon, cilantro, and more seeds if desired.
