Socca "Pizza" with Fresh Chickpea Pesto

Socca:
1 c chickpea flour
1 tsp salt 3/4 c water
2 tbsp olive oil
1 garlic clove, finely grated
pinch cumin
freshly ground black pepper to taste

In a large bowl, whisk all the ingredients together until a smooth batter forms. Cover in plastic wrap and let sit for 1 hr.

Pesto:
8 oz (4 c whole fresh chickpeas shucked) 1 c
kosher salt to taste
1/4 c olive oil
1/4 c fresh chervil leaves
2 tbsp lemon juice
1 tbsp pistachios
1 tsp lemon zest
1 garlic clove roughly chopped

Bring a small pot of water to a boil and prepare an ice bath. Season the water with salt. Add the fresh chickpeas and cook until tender, 2 min. Using a slotted spoon, transfer the chickpeas to the ice bath. Once cool, drain the chickpeas and remove their thin shells around the green centers. Transfer the chickpeas to a small food processor with the remaining pesto ingredients. Pulse until a smooth paste comes together, then season with salt.

Assembly:
1 tbsp olive oil + more for drizzling
2 oz goat cheese, crumbled (1/4 c)
1 serrano chile, thinly sliced
chopped pistachios for garnish
mache rosettes for garnish
chervil leaves for garnish
flaky sea salt for garnish


Preheat broiler with the rack 6" from the heat source. In a 10" ovenproof, non-stick pan, heat the olive oil over medium high heat. Pour the batter into the pan, swirling to cover the entire surface, then transfer the pan to the oven. Bake until the socca sets, 5-6 min. Remove the pan from the oven. Spread the pesto over the socca and dot with goat cheese. Return to the oven and broil until the cheese is slightly golden, 4 min. Trasfer the socca to a board and top with all the garnishes.
