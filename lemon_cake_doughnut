  --Chris Morocco

2 1/2 tsp baking powder
2 c ap flour + more for dusting
1 tsp kosher salt + more
2 large egg yolks
1 c whole milk greek yogurt
1/2 c sugar
2 tbsp unsalted butter, melted, slightly cooled
1 tsp vanilla
vegetable oil for frying
1 c powdered sugar
zest from 1/4 lemon
1/4 c water

Whisk baking powder, flour, and salt in a medium bowl. Whisk yolks, yogurt, sugar, butter, and vanilla in a large bowl until smooth. Mix in dry ingredients with a spoon or rubber spatula until dough comes together and is smooth with no spots of flour remaining. Turn dough onto well floured sheet of parchment or waxed paper. Dust dough with more flour, place another large sheet of parchment or waxed paper over, and roll to 1/2" thick. Remove top sheet and brush off any excess flour with dry pastry brush. Punch out circles ~3 1/2" in diameter with a biscuit cutter, large glass, or mug. Punch out centers ~1" in diameter with small biscuit cutter or bottle cap (or poke hole with chopstick and pull to widen). Reroll any scraps and punch out additional doughnuts and holes. Fit a large pot with a fry thermometer and pour in oil to depth of 1 1/2". Heat over medium high until thermometer registers 350F. Fry doughnuts, turning once, until puffy and browned, ~2 min per side. Transfer to wire rack and let cool 10 min before glazing. While they cool, whisk powdered sugar, lemon zest, a tiny pinch of salt, and water in a small bowl until smooth. Dip each side of doughnut into glaze, letting excess run off before returning to rack. Eat.
