  --Kate Davis

1 c (2 sticks) unsalted butter
2 c apflour
1 tsp baking soda
3/4 tsp kosher salt
1 c (packed) dark brown sugar
1/3 c sugar
2 large eggs, room temp
2 tsp vanilla
2x1.4 oz chocolate toffee bars (preferably Skor) chopped into 1/4" pieces
1 1/2 c chocolate wafers (preferably 72% cacao)
flaky salt (optional)

Cook butter in a medium saucepan over medium heat, stirring often, until it foams, then browns, 5-8 min. Scrape in to a large bowl and let cool slightly. Whisk flour, baking soda, and sat in a medium bowl. Add sugars to butter in the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with paddle attachment. Beat until incorporated, ~1 min. Add eggs and vanilla, increase speed to medium high and beat until mixture lightens and begins to thicken, ~1 min. Reduce speed to low; add dry ingredients and beat just to combine. Mix in toffee and chocolate. Let dough sit at room temp at least 30 min to allow the flour to hydrate. Place rack in middle of oven; preheat to 375F. Using a 1 1/2 oz ice creem scoop, portion out dough balls on a parchment lined baking sheet, spacing ~3" apart. Do not flatten; cookies will spread as they bake. Sprinkle with salt (if using. Bake cookies until edges are golden brown and firm, but centers are still soft, 9-11 min. Let cool on baking sheet for 10 min, then transfer to rack and let cool completely. Dough can be made 3 days ahead; cover and chill; let dough come to room temp before baking.
