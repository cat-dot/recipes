  --feedmephoebe

1/2 c creamy peanut butter
2 tbsp fish sauce
2 tbsp gluten-free tamari
2 tbsp rice vinegar
2 tbsp fresh lime juice from one lime
2 tbsp maple syrup
14 oz can full fat coconut milk
1 c chicken stock or water
1 bunch scallions thinly sliced, white and green parts separated
2 tbsp finely chopped fresh ginger
1 small red Thai chile thinly sliced (optional)
1 c arborio or bomba rice though any short grain white rice will work
1/2 tsp sea salt

1 lb boneless skinless chicken thighs
1/2 tsp ground turmeric
1/2 tsp ground coriander
1/2 tsp ground ginger
1/2 tsp sea salt
1 tsp sriracha
1 tbsp grapeseed or other neutral oil
2 tbsp lime juice from one lime
2 small kirby or persian cucumbers for garnish

Preheat oven to 375F. In a large mixing bowl, whisk together the peanut butter, fish sauce, tamari, vinegar, lime juice, and maple syrup. Add the coconut milk and water and continue whisking until well-combined. Fold in the white and light green scallions, ginger, chile (if using), rice, and sea salt. Transfer the whole mixture to a large (10") oven-proof skillet or 9x13" baking dish. To the same mixing bowl (itâ€™s fine if some casserole mixture remains), combine the chicken, ground turmeric, ground coriander, ground ginger, salt, sriracha, oil and lime juice. Arrange the chicken on top of the peanut butter rice mixture in the skillet or baking dish. Bake the casserole for 45 min, or until the rice is tender and most of the liquid is absorbed. Remove from the oven and allow to rest for 5 min. Garnish with the sliced cucumbers and green scallions.



Notes: To make this Low FODMAP, simply reduce the coconut milk to 1 c and increase the water or low FODMAP chicken stock by 1 c, and omit the sriracha.
