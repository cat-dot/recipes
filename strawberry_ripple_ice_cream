  --Cooks Illustrated

Cream Base:
1/2 c + 1/3 c nonfat dry milk powder
1/2 c (3 1/2 oz) sugar
1/4 tsp kosher salt
1 1/4 c + 1/4 c whole milk, divided
1 1/2 c heavy cream
1/4 c corn syrup
1 tbsp + 2 tsp cornstarch

In a small bowl, whisk together powdered milk, sugar, and salt. Whisk sugar mixture, milk, cream, and corn syrup together in large saucepan. Cook over medium high heat until tiny bubbles form around edge of saucepan and mixture registers 190F/87.8C, whisking frequently to dissolve sugar and break up any clumps, ~5-7 min. Meanwhile, whisk remaining milk and cornstarch together in small bowl. Reduce heat to medium. Whisk cornstarch mixture to recombine, then whisk into saucepan. Cook, constantly scraping bottom of saucepan with rubber spatula, until mixture thickens, ~30 s. Immediately pour into large bowl and let cool until no longer steaming, ~20 min. Cover bowl, transfer to refrigerator, and chill to 40F/4.4C, at least 6 hrs or up to 8 hrs. Can be chilled overnight.

Ripple:
6 oz fresh strawberries, hulled
1/2 c + 1 tbsp (4 oz) sugar
1 c (1/2 oz) freeze-dried strawberries

Combine all ingredients in a blender and blend on high speed until smooth, ~1 min. Transfer to airtight container and refrigerate until ready to sue.

Churn base in ice cream maker until mixture resembles thick soft-serve ice cream and registers 21F/-6.1C. Spread 1/4 of ice cream in bottom of airtight container and top with 1/4 c ripple. Repeat 3 more times. Cover, transfer to freezer, and freeze until hard, at least 2 hrs or up to 8 hrs.
