Welsh Rarebit

Cheese Sauce:
3 tbsp unsalted butter
1 garlic clove, smashed
1 bay leaf
3 tbsp ap flour
1 c dark ale (i.e. newcastle)
1 3/4 c shredded 2 yr aged cheddar cheese (6 oz)
1 tbsp worcestershire sauce
1/4 tsp tobasco
kosher salt & freshly ground pepper to taste

In a medium saucepan, heat the butter, garlic, and bay leaf over medium heat. When the butter begins to foam, gradually add the flour, stirring constantly with a wooden spoon. Cook until bubbling and thickened, creating a blond roux, 3-4 min. Slowly add the beer and bring to a boil, constantly stirring until a thick sauce forms, 1-2 min. Remove from the heat and immediately stir in the shredded cheddar, worcestershire, and tobasco. Return the saucepan to low heat, stirring often, until the cheese is just dissolved, 1.5 min. Remove from the heat and adjust the seasoning with salt and pepper, then transfer to a small bowl. Cover the cheese sauce with plastic wrap, letting the wrap directly touch the sauce, and chill in the fridge until it sets, min 30 min and up to 3 days. Makes 1 1/2 c.


Rarebit:
1/3 c celery leaves (from 1 bunch celery)
3-4 scallions, green parts only, finely sliced lengthwise and soaked in cold water
4 3/4" thick slices of good, crusty bread (i.e. boule or levain) toasted
4 lemon wedges

10 min before serving, preheat the oven to broil and remove the cheese sauce from the fridge. While the oven is heating, in a small bowl, toss together the celery leaves and scallions; set aside. Line a rimmed baking sheet with aluminum foil and arrange the toasted bread slices in a single layer. Slather a generous amount of cheese sauce over each slice, then broil until the sauce begins to bubble and blister, 2-3 min. To serve, top each with the celery-scallion garnish and plate the lemon wedge alongside.
