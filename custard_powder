Custard Powder
  --Marie Roffey
  
1 c milk powder
1/2 c corn flour (cornstarch)
1/4 tsp powdered yellow food colouring
1 1/2 tbsp (6 tsp) vanilla sugar

Add the milk powder, corn flour, food colouring and vanilla to a food processor and blend for ~10 s. Transfer to an airtight container and store in the pantry.


To make into custard:
1/2 c homemade custard powder
2 c milk
1-2 tbsp sugar (to taste)

Add custard powder to a small saucepan with the sugar and milk. Whisk to combine, then heat over low heat stirring constantly until thick and beginning to bubble. Add more milk if you want a thinner consistency.



Substitutions:
Powdererd milk – you can use skim or full cream powdered milk. I use skim.
Vanilla Sugar – you could use vanilla extract or real vanilla beans (the mixture will have lumps but as long as they’re evenly dispersed, it’s still fine to use)
 or make your own by blitzing together vanilla bean seeds and granulated sugar in a food processor
 use vanilla extract – this will result in lumps but as long as they are as small as possible and distributed evenly it will be fine. 
 use regular granulated sugar in place of the vanilla sugar and add the seeds from half a vanilla bean to the mixture.
Milk – when adding the liquid milk you can use light or full cream milk or even water if you want to keep it lighter.
Sugar – when cooking, add sugar to your own taste. The amount in the recipe for me is perfect sweetness but you may like it sweeter.
