Lentil Burgers  gf
  --Chris Morocco
  
1 c dried green lentils
1/2 c whole milk greek yogurt
1/4 tsp finely grated lemon zest
1 tbsp fresh lemon juice
2 garlic cloves, finely grated, divided
kosher salt
6 oz crimini mushrooms, stems trimmed
2 tbsp white miso
1/4 tsp smoked paprika
4 tbsp evoo, divided + more
1/4 c (or more) oat, gf 1:1: blend, or ap flour

Pour water into large saucepan to cover lentils by 4". Bring to a boil, reduce heat to medium, and simmer, stirring occasionally, until lentils are tender but not mushy, ~10 min from the time the water reaches a boil. Drain very well in a fine mesh sieve, then let cool at least 10 min (spread out on baking sheet to cool faster). Meanwhile, combine yogurt, lemon zest, jemon juice, and half of garlic in a small bowl. Season with salt; set aside. Finely chop mushrooms and transfer to medium bowl. Add miso, paprika, 2 tbsp oil, and remaining garlic. Add lentils (should be ~2 c) and stir and mash until lentils are partly mashed but some whole lentils still remaining. Vigorously stir in flour until mixture holds together when squeezed; if it doesn't, continue to mash until it does and add 1-2 tbsp more flour. For into 6 patties ~3/4" thick. Working in 2 batches, heat 1 tbsp oil in large nonstick skillet over medium. Cook patties until deeply browned and very crisp on bottom side, ~3 min. Carefully flip and repeat on second side, adding more oil as needed. Spread yogurt mixture on buns, top with burgers and desired accoutrement. 


Notes: Patties can be made 4 days ahead. Tightly wrap in plastic and chill. Can use dairy free yogurt to make these vegan (or use vegan spread of choice and skip sauce)
