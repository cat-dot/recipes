Lemon Pudding Cakes
  --America's Test Kitchen

1 c whole milk
1/2 c heavy cream
3 tbsp grated lemon zest 
1/2 c lemon juice (3 lemons)
1 c (7oz) sugar, divided
1/4 c (1 1/4oz) ap flour
1/2 tsp baking powder
1/8 tsp salt
2 large eggs, separated + 2 large whites
1/2 tsp vanilla

Adjust oven rack to middle position and preheat to 325F. Bring milk and cream to simmer in medium saucepan over medium high heat. Remove pan from heat, whisk in lemon zest, cover pan, and let stand for 15 min. Meanwhile, fold dish towel in half and place in bottom of large roasting pan. Place 6x6oz ramekins on top of towel and set aside pan. Strain milk mixture through fine mesh strainer into bowl, presseing on lemon zest to extract liquid; discard zest. Whisk 3/4 c sugar, flour, baking powder, and salt in second bowl until combined. Add egg yolks, vanilla, lemon juice, and milk mixture and whisk until combined. Batter will have consistency of milk. Using a stand mixer fitted with whisk, whip egg whites on medium low speed until foamy, ~1 min. Increase speed to medium high and whip whites to soft, billowy mounds, ~1 min. Gradually add remaining 1/4 c sugar and whip until glossy, soft peaks form, 1-2 min. Whisk 1/4 of whites into batter to lighten. With rubber spatula, gently fold in remaining whites until no clumbs or streaks remain. Ladle batter into ramekins. Pour enough cold water into pan to come 1/3 of way up sides of ramekins. Bake until cake is set and pale golden brown and pudding layer registers 172-175F at center, 50-55min. Remove pan from oven and let ramekins stand in water bath for 10 min. Transfer to wire rack and let cool completely to serve.

Notes: To take the temperature of the pudding layer, touch the probe tip to the bottom of the ramekin and pull it up 1/4". The batter can also be baked in an 8" square glass baking dish. This dessert can be served at room temperature or chilled (the texture will be firmer).
