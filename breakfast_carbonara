Breakfast Carbonara

kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper to taste
2 tbsp olive oil
1/2 lb slab bacon, 1/3" dice
1 lb spaghetti
1 medium onion, finely diced
3/4 c finely grated parmesan cheese + more for garnish
3 eggs
chopped parsley for garnish

Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil. In a large skillet, heat the olive oil over medium heat. Add the bacon and fry until golden brown and rendered, 6 min. Using a slotted spoon, transfer to a bowl and reserve. Once the pot of water is boiling, add the pasta and cook, stirring occasionally, until al dente, 9-10 min. Drain the pasta, reserving 1/2 c of cooking liquid. Add the onions to the pan with the rendered bacon fat and saute until they begin to brown at the edges, 8 min. Add the reserved bacon and pasta water, along with the spaghetti, and toss to coat. In a separate bowl, whisk together the cheese, eggs, and pepper. Remove the pasta from the heat and stir in the egg mixture, tossing until the sauce has thickened and emulsified. Season with salt.
