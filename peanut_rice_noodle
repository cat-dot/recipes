Peanut Rice Noodles with Pork and Collard Greens
  --Chris Morocco
  
12 oz. regular-width rice stick noodles
1/4 c smooth natural peanut butter
1/4 c shoyu
2 tbsp. unseasoned rice vinegar
1 tbsp. sugar
2 tsp. crushed red pepper flakes
1 tbsp. vegetable oil
1 lb. ground pork
1 1/2" piece ginger, peeled, cut into matchsticks
4 garlic cloves, thinly sliced
1 bunch collard greens, ribs and stems removed, leaves thinly sliced

Bringa large saucepan of salted water to a boil. Remove from heat; add noodles. Let sit, stirring occasionally, until al dente, ~4 min (time may vary by brand). Drain and rinse under cold running water. Meanwhile, whisk peanut butter, shoyu, vinegar, sugar, red pepper flakes, and 1 c water in a medium bowl. (Sauce will look a little broken and lumpy.) Heat oil in a large skillet over medium. Cook pork, breaking up with 2 forks, until nearly cooked through, ~5 min. Add ginger and garlic; cook, stirring, until softened, ~3 min. Add collard greens and cook, stirring occasionally, just until wilted, ~2 min. Add sauce and noodles and bring to a simmer; cook, tossing occasionally, until sauce is reduced by half and coats noodles, ~3 min. Season with salt.



Notes: can sub other noodles, other protein, add veggies, etc.
