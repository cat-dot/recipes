Sheet Pan Chow Mein
  --Hetty McKinnon

Mein:
1 bell pepper (any color), finely sliced
1 carrot, peeled and finely sliced diagonally
1 head of broccoli, cut into florets, or bundle of broccolini, cut into 1-2" segments
kosher salt
olive oil or a neutral oil
250 g or 8.8 oz package dried thin egg noodles
1 small can baby corn, drained
6 oz asparagus, sugar snaps, or snow peas, trimmed and cut into 1-2" segments
1 medium shallot or 3 scallions, thinly sliced
2 tbsp toasted sesame seeds, to finish
1 tbsp toasted sesame oil

Heat oven to 425F. On a large baking sheet, toss the pepper, carrot, and broccoli with a splash of olive oil and season with salt. Roast for 10 min, until the vegetables start to soften. Bring a large saucepan of salted water to the boil. Add the egg noodles, and cook according to the packet instructions, or al dente, about 4-5 min. Drain and cool under cold running water. Drain well again and pat dry with a clean tea towel. Remove the baking sheet and push the vegetables to the side. Add the noodles, corn and asparagus. Drizzle the noodles with sesame oil, season with more salt and toss well to coat. Return the tray to the oven and bake for another 15-18 min, until the noodles are crispy on the top and bottom. We are looking for a combination of crispy and non-crispy noodles. 

Sauce:
1 tbsp toasted sesame oil
3 tbsp shoyu, tamari, or coconut aminos
1 tbsp vegetarian stir-fry sauce, such as vegetarian oyster or hoisin sauce (optional)
1/4 tsp ground white pepper
1 small clove garlic, grated or minced

Combine all ingredients in a small bowl; set aside. Remove the tray from the oven, drizzle over the sauce and toss well. Scatter over the shallot and sesame seeds and serve.


Notes: Can use any vegetables, this is just an example
