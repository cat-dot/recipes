Paste:
10 arbol chili, split in half and seeded
2 large shallots, coarsely chopped
2 stalks lemongrass, bottom 6", thinly sliced
4 garlic cloves, chopped
2" galangal, peeled and chopped
2" tumeric
4 thai chilis, stemmed, thinly sliced
4 merkut lime leaves, stem removed, thinly sliced
2 tsp gapi (fermented shrimp paste)
3/4 tsp salt

Put arbol chilis in a cup of boiling water for ~20 min; reserve liquid. Place all ingredients in a glass 2 c measuring cup; blend with an immersion blender until a cohesive paste. Can store up to 4 days in refrigerator or 4 months in freezer.

Curry:
1 tbsp vegetable oil
1 lb ground pork
2 tsp fish sauce
2 tsp light brown sugar
1 tsp black pepper
4 thai chilis sliced thin (optional)
4 merkut lime leaves, stemmed and sliced thin

Heat a 14" wok, add oil and paste and cook until excess moisture is gone and starts to stick. Add pork, stir and cook over medium high heat. Add fish sauce, sugar, and pepper, stirring to combine. If it's too dry, add reserved liquid a little at a time until desired consistency. Once pork is done, remove from heat and add in chilis (if using) and lime leaves. Serve with steamed rice or cooked noodles.
