  --Shalane Flanagan

Dressing:
1/4 c evoo
1/3 c fresh lime juice (2-3 limes)
2 tbsp shoyu 
2 tbsp honey (or maple)
1 tbsp fish sauce (optional)

Combine all ingredients in a glass jar or bowl and stir.
Salad:
1 c quinoa, rinsed and drained
2 c grated carrots (~2 large)
2 c thinly sliced purple cabbage
3 green onions white and green parts sliced
1 c packed mint leaves, chopped (cilantro works too)
1 c packed basil leaves, chopped
1 jalapeno or serrano pepper, seeds removed, minced (optional)
1/2 c roasted peanuts, chopped

In a medium saucepan over high heat, bring 1 1/2 c and quinoa to a boil. Reduce the heat to low and simmer, covered, for 15 min or until all the water has been absorbed. Transfer to a large salad bowl, fluff with a fork, and set aside to cool. Once cool, add the everything except peanuts and toss to combine. Add dressing and toss again. Taste and adjust seasoning (shoyu + fish sauce) as needed. Top with peanuts and chill in the fridge for at least 1 hr or until ready to serve. The salad will stay fresh in airtight glass container in the fridge for up to 5 days.
