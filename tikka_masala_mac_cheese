  --Preeti Mistry

8 green cardamom pods
2 black cardamom pods
3" [7.5-cm] cinnamon stick
8 whole cloves
1 1/2 tsp fenugreek seeds
1 tbsp Indian red chile powder (Kashmiri chile powder)
4 tbsp (56g) unsalted butter
1 tbsp minced, peeled fresh ginger
6 garlic cloves, minced (~2 tbsp)
6 oz (170g) can tomato paste
2 c 480ml) heavy cream
1 c (227g) sour cream
6 oz (255g) gouda cheese, coarsely grated (~1 3/4 c), divided
4 oz (170g) cheddar cheese, coarsely grated (~1 1/2 c)
1/4 c kosher salt, divided
1 lb (453g) uncooked elbow macaroni, shells, or other small shape


Place the green and black cardamom pods, cinnamon stick, cloves, and fenugreek seeds in a small skillet over medium heat. Cook, stirring the spices, until fragrant, ~1 min. Transfer the toasted spices to a clean coffee grinder and pulse until finely ground (or use a large mortar and pestle). Stir in the chile powder and set the mixture aside. Place the butter in a medium saucepan over medium heat. Once it melts, add the ginger and garlic and cook until sizzling and fragrant, ~1 min. Add the reserved spice mixture, tomato paste, cream, and 1/2 c (120 ml) of water. Whisk everything together until the tomato paste dissolves. Let the mixture heat up until bubbles form around the edge, ~5 min, and then whisk in the sour cream, the cheddar cheese, and 4 oz of the gouda cheese. Cook, stirring now and then, until the cheeses melt and sauce is smooth, ~3 min. Season the sauce to taste with 2 tsp salt, decrease the heat to low, and keep the sauce warm. Meanwhile, bring a large pot of water to a boil and season it generously with salt. Add the macaroni and cook according to the package directions. Drain the pasta and return it to the pot. Add the cheese sauce and stir well to combine. Transfer the mixture to a broiler-safe baking dish. Heat your oven broiler. Top the pasta mixture with the remaining 2 oz gouda and broil 3 min or until the cheese melts. Serve immediately.
