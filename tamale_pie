Tamale Pie
  --James Beard

1 1/2 c yellow cornmeal
3 tsp kosher salt, divided
3 tbsp lard or unsalted butter
1/2 lb sausage, casing removed (chorizo or spicy italian)
2 tbsp chile powder
3/4 tsp ground cumin
3 celery stalks, diced
2 large onions, finely chopped
2 garlic cloves, minved
1 small green pepper, seeded and diced
1 1/2 lbs ground beef
28 oz can whole peeled italian tomatoes
2 1/2 c fresh corn cut from cob (or frozen whole kernel corn with juice)
1 c pitted ripe olives, roughly choped
8 oz medium or sharp chedder, grated

In a large pot, whisk together 6 c water with the cornmeal. Bring to a boil while continuously stirring. Turn the heat on low, stir in 1 1/2 tsp salt and lard (or butter). Cover and simmer ~30 min, stirring occasionally. Meanwhile, in a large saute pan, brown the sausage over medium heat, breaking up with a wooden spoon. Once browned, transfer to a bowl and set aside. Add chile powder and cumin to saute pan; let spices toast for several minutes while stirring. Add the celery, onions, garlic, green pepper, and 1 1/2 tsp salt. Stir and cook until vegetables are soft and fond is scraped off the bottom of the pan. Add the beef into the pan and break up the meat; cook until the raw color disappears. Add the tomatoes, breaking them up with your hands over the pan and pour in juices. Add sausage back in and stir in corn; bring to a boil and let the mixture simmer for 15 min. Lightly oil a 12x9x2" baking dish and place in a rimmed baking sheet. Warm cornmeal over low heat and stir until smooth, adding a few tbsp of water if necessary. Spread ~2/3 cornemal mixture on the bottom and up the sides of the pan. Spoon in the filling and distribute the olives evenly around. Spoon the remaining cornmeal evenly over the top and sprinkle with the cheese all over. Bake in a 375F oven until browned and bubbling, ~1 hr. For a darker golden brown, broil for the last 5 min.
