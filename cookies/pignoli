Pignoli                             gf
  --Grossy Pelosi

1 1/2 lb almond paste 
1 1/2 c sugar
1 c confectioner's sugar
4 egg whites 
1 lb pignoli (pine nuts) 

Preheat your oven to 350F. Add almond paste, sugar, confectioner's sugar, and egg whites to the bowl of a stand mixer or just your favorite bowl if you are mixing by hand. Mix until combined into a sticky dough. Scoop enough dough to form ~1" ball of dough. Add ball to bowl of pine nuts, and use your hands to crush pine nuts into the ball of dough. Be careful not to overwork dough or the pine nuts won't stick. Continue this process until you've used up all your dough and each ball is perfectly covered. Place your pignoli-encrusted dough balls on a parchment-lined baking tray and bake for 15-20 minute until golden brown. 



Notes: Dough can be made ahead and frozen. Do not freeze in balls. Defrost dough, form balls, add pignoli and bake. Can use nuts of choice (pistachio, almonds, etc)
