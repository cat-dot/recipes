Madeleines

2 large eggs at room temp
1/2 c granulated suagr
1 c ap flour
1 1/2 tsp baking powder
1/2 tsp salt
1/2 tsp vanilla
10 tbsp unsalted butter
1 tbsp honey

Place the eggs in a bowl of a stand mixer fitted with a whisk attachment. Whip on medium high speed, adding the sugar a little at a time, until all the sugar is incorporated. Turn the mixer to high and whisk until the eggs have doubled in volume, 3-5 min. Remove the bowl from the stand mixer and stir in the flour, baking powder, salt, and vanilla. Cover the bowl and allow to rest for at least 30 min and up to 1hr. Meanwhile, melt the butter in a small saucepan over medium heat. Remove and reserve 2 tbsp for brushing the pans with. Add the honey and cook, stirring until smooth, about 1 min. Remove from the heat and allow to cool ~ 30 min. Stir the butter and honey mixture (warm up to liquefy if necessary) into the batter until smooth. Cover the batter and allow to rest for an additional 30-60min. 
Preheat oven to 400F. In 2 madeleine molds, brush 16 indentations with the reserved butter. Using a tablespoon, fill each indentation 3/4 full with batter. Tap the pan on the counter to distribute the batter evenly. Bake until deep golden brown, 8-10min. Remove from the oven and allow to cool for 30 s, and then tip them out onto a cooling rack.
