Milano (Siciliano) Cookies

1 1/4 c ap flour
1/2 tsp kosher salt
1 stick unsalted butter, softened at room temp
2/3 c sugar
1 tsp vanilla extract
1 large egg
4oz dark chocolate
zest of 1 small orange

Preheat over to 325F. In a small bowl, combine flour and salt. In a medium bowl, beat butter and sugar on high until light and flufff (~4min). Beat in vanilla and egg. Set mixer to low and slowly add in flour mixture, beating until batter is just combined. The dough will be somewhat thick. Place dough into a quart ziptop bag. Push down into one corner of the bag, twisting the top of the bag as you do so. Cut off a 1/2" hole in the corner of the bag and pipe dough into 2" strips on a cookie sheet lined with parchment paper. You may need to pinch the end of the dough to separate it from the plastic bag. The dough strips will look almost like stubby fingers or skinny bananas on the sheet, but will spread out and take the shape of a Milano once in the oven.  Bake the cookies until they turn golden at the edges, ~13 min. Remove from oven and transfer to a wire rack to cool. 
Melt chocolate in a heatproof bowl over a saucepan of simmering water. Let gool 5 min. Using an offset spatula or spoon, spread chocoalte on the flat side of one cookie, sprinkle a bit of orange zest, top with another cookie and squeeze to sandwich them together. Be sure to use just enough chocolate to reach the edges of the cookies. Allow chocolate to set before serving, even putting cookies in fridge for 20 min if necessary.
