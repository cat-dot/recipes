Eggless Chocolate Chip Cookies
  --Marley Braunlich

1/2 c salted butter, softened
1/4 c white sugar
3/4 c brown sugar, lightly packed
1/4 c water, room temperature
2 tsp vanilla
1 3/4 c ap flour, spooned and leveled
3/4 tsp baking soda
1/4 tsp baking powder
1/2 tsp salt
1 c chocolate chips (I use ½ cup dark and ½ cup semi-sweet)

Cream together softened butter and sugars for several min until light and fluffy, scraping down the sides. Gradually add in water and vanilla and beat to combine. (The water will cause the mixture to appear curdled. Turn your mixer on medium-high and beat for a few more min to bring the ingredients back together.) To a mixing bowl, add dry ingredients including flour, baking soda, baking powder and salt. Add to butter mixture and stir to combine. Stir in the chocolate chips and chill the cookie dough in the fridge for 30 min or more. Use a cookie scoop or spoon to portion out the dough to 2" balls. Place on a parchment lined baking sheet and bake on the center rack at 350F until the edges are golden brown, for ~12 min. The cookie centers will look puffy and under-baked, but trust the process! Let the cookies cool to set. They will flatten out and continue cooking after they're removed from the oven. Wait until the cookies are set, 5 min or so, before transferring so they don't fall apart.


Notes: I browned the butter for more flavor and found I had to add more butter/water as the dough was too dry. I also add toasted walnuts
