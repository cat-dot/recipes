Gingersnaps
  --PJ Hamel, King Arthur 

Cookies:
3/4 c (138g) vegetable shortening
1 c (198g) sugar
1/2 tsp  salt
2 tsp baking soda
1 large egg
1/3 c (113g) molasses
2 1/3 c (280g) ap flour
1-2 tsp ginger
1/2 tsp cloves
1 tsp cinnamon

Preheat the oven to 375F. Lightly grease (or line with parchment) two baking sheets. Beat together the shortening, sugar, salt, and baking soda. Beat in the egg, then the molasses. Add the flour and spices, beating to make a smooth, fairly stiff dough. 

Coating:
1/4 c (50g) sugar
1 tsp cinnamon

Combine the sugar and cinnamon, and place in a shallow pan or dish.

Drop the dough in 1" balls into the cinnamon-sugar mixture; a tsp cookie scoop is perfect here. Roll the balls in the sugar to coat, then transfer them to the prepared baking sheets, leaving at least 1 1/2" between them; they'll spread as they bake. Bake the gingersnaps for 11 min, for cookies that are crisp around the edges, and "bendy" in the center. Bake for 13 min, for cookies that are crisp/crunchy all the way through. Remove the gingersnaps from the oven, and cool right on the pan, or on a rack. Cool completely, then store tightly wrapped, at room temperature. 



Notes: IF you use butter, cookies will not be crisp. Add more spices/nutmeg to taste
