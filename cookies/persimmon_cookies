Persimmon Cookies
  --Candice Walker
  
150 g sugar (3/4 c)
1/2 c unsalted butter room temperature (or margarine, or shortening)
1 egg room temperature
1 c persimmon puree very ripe and mushy
200 g ap flour (1.5 c)
1/2 tsp salt
1 tsp baking soda
1/2 tsp cinnamon
1/2 tsp cloves
1/2 tsp freshly grated nutmeg
3/4 c chocolate chips (optional)
3/4 c pecans optional

Preheat your oven to 350. Cream together your 150 g (3/4 c) of sugar and 1/2 c of butter until combined in a creamy mixture. Add an egg and the blended persimmon pulp to the creamed butter and sugar. Scrape down the sides of the bowl before adding the dry ingredients. Add the flour, salt,baking soda, cinnamon, cloves, and nutmeg to the mix. If you're doing the optional addition, add chocolate chips and pecans (or another nut of choice). Mix gently and thoroughly to get the dough to come together. Drop the dough onto a lightly greased cookie sheet (or on a silicone baking mat) in equal sizes, ~2+ tbsp each, with only 6-8 cookies per half baking sheet. This recipe makes 20 persimmon cookies. Bake the cookies for 13-18 minutes until the bottom edges begin to golden. Allow to cool slightly then enjoy!


Notes: Use a food processor/blender to blend your over-ripe persimmons into a pulp. Blend it, but donâ€™t completely puree it as you still want small pieces of persimmon in the cookies.
