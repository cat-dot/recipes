Almond Cookies
  --Garrett McCord
  
1 1/3 c almond flour, lightly packed
1 c unsalted butter, chilled and cut into cubes
pinch of kosher salt
2 eggs
1 tsp of almond extract
1 3/4 c of flour
1 c + 2 tbsp of sugar
1/2 teastsppoon of baking soda
thinly sliced almonds

Place the almond flour, salt, and butter into an electric mixer with a paddle attachment and beat on medium speed for three min. The mixture will become coarse and chunky looking. Add 1 egg and almond extract and mix on low until just incorporated. Sift together the flour, sugar, and baking soda then add to the butter mixture at low speed. Mix until just combined. Take the dough and flatten it into a disc and wrap in plastic wrap. Place it in the refrigerator for 2 hr to chill. Preheat the oven to 325F. Line a baking sheet with parchment paper. Place the other egg into a bowl and beat it. Take pieces of dough and roll them into balls ~3/4" wide. Place them on the sheet ~1" apart and then press them down slightly with your palm to make a coin shape. Place a slivered almond onto each cookie and lightly press it into place, then paint the surface of the cookie with some of the beaten egg using a pastry brush or your finger (this will give the cookie a lacquered appearance once it bakes). Bake for 13-15 min or until the edges just begin to tan. Cool on the sheet on a wire rack.



Notes: I used amaretto/frangelico instead of almond extract, ymmv. Pro tip: form cookie dough into balls and place on a parchment/silicone lined tray in refrigerator to chill (at least 1 hr) Can freeze dough balls and thaw for later use.
