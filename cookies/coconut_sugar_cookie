Coconut Sugar Cookie

2 c almond flour
2 tbsp coconut oil, melted
1/2 c coconut palm sugar
2 eggs
1 tbsp vanilla
1/4 tsp fine sea salt

Whisk all wet ingredients in a small bowl to combine. Whisk all dry ingredients in a medium bowl to combine, getting rid of as meany lumps as possible. Pour wet into dry and mix until all the dry have absorbed the wet. This is best done with a rubber spatula. Place the dough in the fridge for 20-30 min (up to overnight) and preheat oven to 350F. Roll the dough into balls about the size of a quarter and place on a parchment paper lined baking sheet. These cookies do not spread so you can place fairly close. Use a fork of the back of a spoon to flatten the dough balls. Spray the utencil of choice with cooking spray to prevent sticking. Bake for 10-14 min until edges are golden brown. 10 min for doughy, 14 for crunchy. Cool for at least 5 min before serving. 

Note: these cookies freeze well and travel well in ziploc baggies.
