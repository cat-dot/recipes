Perfect Chocolate Chip Cookies

  --Cook's Illustrated

1 3/4 c ap flour (8 3/4 oz)
1/2 tsp baking soda
14 tbsp unsalted butter (1 3/4 sticks)
1/2 c sugar (3 1/2 oz)
3/4 c packed dark brown sugar (5 1/4 oz)
1 tsp salt
2 tsp vanilla
1 large egg
1 large egg yolk
1 1/4 c semisweet chocolate chips or chunks
3/4 c chopped pecans or walnuts, toasted (optional)

Adjust oven rack to middle position and heat to 375F. Line 2 large baking sheets with parchment paper. Whisk flour and baking soda together in medium bowl, set aside. Heat 10 tbsp butter in 10" skillet over medium high heat until melted, ~2 min. Continue cooking, swirling pan constantly until butter is dark golden brown and has nutty aroma, 1-3 min. Remove skillet from heat and, using heatproof spatula, transfer browned butter to large heatproof bowl. Stir remaining 4 tbsp butter into hot butter until completely melted. Add both sugars, salt, and vanilla to bowl with butter and whisk until fully incorporated. Add egg and yolk and whisk until mixture is smooth with no sugar lumps remaining, ~30 s. Let mixture stand 3 min, then whisk for 30 s. Repeat process of resting and whisking 2 more times until mixture is thick, smooth, and shiny. Using rubber spatual or wooden spoon, stir in flour mixture until just combined, ~1 min. Stir in chocolate chips and nuts, giving dough final stir to ensure no flour pockets remain. Divide dough into 16 portions, each about 3 tbsp. Arrange 2" apart on prepared sheets, 8 balls per sheet. Bake cookies 1 tray at a time until cookies are golden brown and still puffy, and edges have begun to set but centers re still soft, 10-14 min, rotating halfway through baking. Transfer baking sheet to wire rack; cool cookies completely before serving.
