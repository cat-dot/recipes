Toasted Sesame Cookies
  --Sarah Kieffer

1 3/4 c (249 g) ap flour
3/4 tsp salt
1/2 tsp baking soda
12 tbsp (1 1/2 sticks or 170 g) unsalted butter, at room temperature
1 c (200 g) granulated sugar
1/2 c (100 g) brown sugar
1 large egg
2 tbsp toasted sesame oil
1 tbsp water
1 1/2 tsp pure vanilla extract
3 oz (85 g) bittersweet or semisweet chocolate, chopped into bite-size pieces (~1/2" with some smaller and some larger, optional)
black and white sesame seeds, for rolling

Adjust an oven rack to the middle of the oven. Heat the oven to 350F (180C). Line three sheet pans with aluminum foil, dull-side up. In a small bowl, whisk together the flour, salt, and baking soda. In the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with a paddle, beat the butter on medium speed until creamy, ~1 min. Add the sugars and beat on medium speed until light and fluffy, 2-3 min. Add the egg, toasted sesame oil, water, and vanilla, and mix on low speed to combine. Add the flour mixture and mix on low speed until combined. Add the chocolate, if using, and mix until combined. Form the dough into 3 oz (85 g) balls (1/4 c). Roll in the sesame seeds, and place 4 cookies an equal distance apart on each sheet pan. Bake the cookies one pan at a time. Bake until the dough balls have spread flat but are puffed slightly in the center, 9 min. Lift one side of the sheet pan up ~4" (10 cm) and gently let it drop down against the oven rack, so the edges of the cookies set and the center falls back down. After the cookies puff up again in 2 min, repeat lifting and dropping the pan. Repeat a few more times to create ridges around the edge of the cookie. Bake for 15-16 min total, until the cookies have spread out and the edges are golden brown but the centers are much lighter and not fully cooked. Transfer the pan to a wire rack. Let the cookies cool for 10 min, then move them to a wire rack to finish cooling. Store cookies in an airtight container at room temperature for 2 days (or refrigerate for up to 3 days).
