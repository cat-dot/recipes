Gochujang Caramel Cookies
  --Eric Kim, NYT Cooking

1/2 c (8 tbsp/ 115g) unsalted butter, very soft, divided
2 packed tbsp dark brown sugar
1 heaping tbps gochujang
1 c (200g) sugar
1 large egg at room temp
1/2 tsp coarse kosher salt or 3/4 tsp kosher salt
1/4 tsp cinnamon
1 tsp vanilla
1/2 tsp baking soda
1 1/2 c (185g) ap flour

In a small bowl, stir together 1 tbsp butter, brown sugar, and gochujang until smooth. Set aside for later.In a large bowl, by hand whisk together the remaining 7 tbsp butter, sugar, egg, salt, cinnamon, and vanilla until smooth, ~1 min. Switch to a flexible spatula and stir in the baking soda. Add the flour and gently stir to combine. Place bowl in refrigerator until the dough is less sticky but still soft and pliable, 15-20 min. While dough is chilling, heat oven to 350F and line 2 large pans with parchment. Remove the dough from the refrigerator. In 3-4 separately spaced out blobs, spoon the gochujang mixture over the dough. Moving in long circulate strokes, swirl the gochunjang mixture into the dough so you have streaks of orange-red rippled throughout. Be sure no to ovemix at this stage. Use an ice cream scoop to plop out 1/4 c rounds, spaced at least 3" apare on the pans (should get 4-5 cookies per pan) Bake until lightly golden at the edges and dry and set in the center, 11-13 min, rotating the pans halfway through. Let cool completely on the pan; the ccookies will flatten slightly and continue cooking as they cool.
