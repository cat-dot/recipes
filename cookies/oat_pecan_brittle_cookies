  --Claire Saffitz
  
Brittle:
1 1/4 c coarsely chopped pecans (5oz / 142g)
3/4 c granulated sugar (5.3oz / 150g)
4 tbsp unsalted butter (2 oz / 57g)
1/2 tsp baking soda
1/2 tsp Diamond Crystal kosher salt 

Toast the pecans. Mix salt and baking soda in small bowl; set aside. In a small saucepan, melt butter and sugar over medium low heat, stirring until sugar is dissolved, then swirl, until golden ~8-10 min. Have a quarter pan lined with parchment at the ready. Turn off heat and add pecans and stir until evenly distributed, then stir in salt mixture and quickly pour onto prepared pan, spreading into an even layer. Let cool until hardened, then break into pea sized pieces and set aside.

Cookies:
2 sticks unsalted butter (8 oz/ 227g), cut into tablespoons
1 1/3 c ap flour (6.1oz / 173g)
2 tsp Diamond Crystal kosher salt (0.22 oz / 6g)
1 tsp baking soda (0.21 oz / 6g)
2 c old-fashioned rolled oats, not quick-cooking (7 oz / 200g)
3/4 c packed dark brown sugar (5.3 oz / 150g)
1/2 c granulated sugar (3.5 oz / 100g)
2 large eggs (3.5 oz / 100g) cold from refrigerator
1 tbsp vanilla extract

Brown half the butter, place the other half into the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with paddle attachement. Put flour, salt, baking soda, half the oats, and half the pecan brittle into food processor and process until fine, no big pieces. Pour the browned butter into the stand mixer bowl, letting the 2 butters normalize to room temp. Add sugars and mix until well combined, not creamed, add vanilla and continue mixing. Add eggs one at a time, mixing in between additions. Add flour, slowly mix until combined, then add remaining oats and brittle and mix. Refrigerate dough for min 2 hr up to overnight (8-24hr). Portion dough out into 2 oz balls (1/4 c) onto parchment lined baking sheets, giving plenty of room for spread (~3" apart, 6 per sheet). Bake at 350F for 16-20 min. Let them cool on the pan before moving to cooling rack. Makes ~18 large cookies
