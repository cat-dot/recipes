Coconut Custard Macaroons
  --Daniell Kartes

6 1/2 c (510g) sweetened, shredded coconut (~6 1/2 c)
1 large egg
1/2 c (110g) unsalted butter, melted and slightly cooled
1 tsp pure vanilla extract (available kosher for Passover)
3/4 tsp fleur de sel or other large-flake sea salt
3/4 c (235g) sweetened condensed milk

Mix all ingredients until batter is completely mixed. Use a 2 tbsp ice-cream scoop to distribute equal portions of the mixture onto a parchment-lined cookie sheet. You must line your baking sheet with parchment or a silicone baking mat or the cookies will stick like glue. Bake at 375F until all edges and tops of cookies are dark golden brown, ~14 min. Depending on the weather, cookies might need a few additional minutes to bake. Let cookies set on cookie sheet for ~5 minâ€”no more than 20, or they may stick! Transfer to a cooling rack to continue cooling. Make sure they are completely cool before packing up (I recommend leaving them out to dry as long as possible), and leave the container cracked to help keep them crisp and chewy.



Notes: in video they use whole can of condensed milk - not careful on measuring coconut
