Lace Cookies
  --America's Test Kitchen

8 tbsp unsalted butter
3/4 c dark brown sugar
1/2 c light corn syrup
1 tsp vanilla
1/4 tsp table salt
6 tbsp unbleached ap flour, sifted
1 c pecans or almonds, chopped fine
1 tbsp heavy cream

Adjust oven rack to center position and heat oven to 350 F. Bring butter, brown sugar, and corn syrup just to boil in medium saucepan over medium heat, 5-6 min, stirring frequently. Off heat, beat in vanilla, salt, flour, nuts, and cream until smooth. Drop rounded teaspoonsful of batter at 3" intervals onto cookie sheet lined with baking sheet liner or parchment, estimating 6 cookies per sheet. For larger cookies, substitute 1 tbsp for the tsp and estimate 5 cookies per sheet. Bake cookies until spread thin, deep golden brown, and bubbling has subsided, 6-7 min, or 7-8 min for larger cookies. Let cookies cool and firm up slightly on sheet, 1-2 min. Following instructions below, transfer to wire rack with thin spatula or shape as desired. If desired, follow instruction in "Decorating with Chocolate" to decorate cookies. Cookies can be stored in airtight container up to 1 month.


Decorating with chocolate:
You can melt ~6 oz of semisweet chocolate over simmering water or use any glaze of your choice. Lay cookies on waxed paper to set. Flat cookies may be painted with a pastry brush or spoon, or you may dip the bottom into the glaze. Another option for flat cookies is to place them on a sheet of waxed paper, and then drizzle chocolate with a pastry bag.
