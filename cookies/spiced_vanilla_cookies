Spiced Vanilla Cookies
  --Heilala Vanilla

1 c (250g) butter  
1 c brown sugar  
1 egg  
2 tbsp molasses  
1 1/2 tsp vanilla   
3 cups plain flour  
1/2 tsp baking powder  
2 tsp ground cinnamon  
1 1/2 tsp ground ginger  
1/2 tsp ground allspice  
1/2 tsp ground white pepper  
1/2 tsp ground cloves  
1/2 tsp sea salt

Beat the butter and sugar until pale and creamy. Add the egg and combine well. Beat in the molasses and vanilla. Sift the flour, baking powder and spices together add slowly to the butter mixture making sure to combine well after each addition. Separate the dough into two pieces. Flatten and wrap firmly in plastic wrap. Refrigerate overnight to allow the spices to infuse into the dough. When you are ready to bake, preheat oven to 345F. Work with one piece at a time, keeping the second piece in the refrigerator until you are ready to use, roll out on a well-floured board to 1/8 inch thick. Working quickly so the dough does not become too soft, cut with a cookie press or cutter to create the Festive design of your choice. Place the cookies on a lined baking tray and chill until firm again. Bake for 8-10 min until lightly golden. Cool before removing from the tray. Makes ~5 dozen.
