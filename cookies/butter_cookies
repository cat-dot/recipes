Butter Cookies
  --Alice Medrich

8 oz unsalted butter
3/4 c sugar
1/4 tsp salt
1 1/2 tsp vanilla
1 large egg yolk
2 c ap flour

Beat the butter, sugar, salt and vanilla together until smooth and creamy. Mix in the egg yolk until well incorporated, scraping down the sides of the bowl at least once. Add the flour and mix just until incorporated. Scrape onto a lightly floured board and knead a few times, just until the dough smooths out.Turn onto a sheet of plastic wrap and roll into a log, wrap up and refrigerate for several hours or freeze. When ready to bake, preheat oven to 325F and line baking sheets with parchment. Slice the dough into slices about 1/8" thick and place them on the sheets ~1" apart. Bake until JUST beginning to turn golden around the edges, ~16-18 min.
Makes 4 dozen.
