Butter Cookies
  --Alice Medrich

8 oz unsalted butter
3/4 c sugar
1/4 tsp salt
1 1/2 tsp vanilla
1 large egg yolk
2 c ap flour

Beat the butter, sugar, salt and vanilla together until smooth and creamy. Mix in the egg yolk until well incorporated, scraping down the sides of the bowl at least once. Add the flour and mix just until incorporated. Scrape onto a lightly floured board and knead a few times, just until the dough smooths out.Turn onto a sheet of plastic wrap and roll into a log, wrap up and refrigerate for several hours or freeze. When ready to bake, preheat oven to 325F and line baking sheets with parchment. Slice the dough into slices about 1/8" thick and place them on the sheets ~1" apart. Bake until JUST beginning to turn golden around the edges, ~16-18 min.
Makes 4 dozen.

  --Ceil Wallace

1 c butter
1 c sugar
1 large egg
2 tsp vanilla 
2 2/3 c ap flour
1/4 tsp salt

Beat butter and sugar together in a large bowl with an electric mixer until light and fluffy. Beat in egg, then stir in the vanilla. Combine flour and salt in a separate bowl; add to butter mixture and mix to form a dough. Cover dough with plastic wrap and chill for at least 1 hr. Preheat the oven to 400F. Chill two cookie sheets. Transfer chilled dough to a cookie press; press out onto chilled cookie sheets. Bake in the preheated oven until lightly golden at the edges, ~8-10 min. Transfer cookies to wire racks to cool.

Note: roll into logs, wrap in waxed paper, and chill. When chilled, I then brush the logs with beaten egg, then roll in raw/turbinado sugar, slice, then bake according to the recipe
