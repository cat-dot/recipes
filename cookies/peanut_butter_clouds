Peanut Butter Clouds
  --Jennifer Segal

3 large egg whites, at room temperature (see note)
1/8 tsp cream of tartar
2/3 c sugar
1/3 c smooth peanut butter, well stirred
3 tbsp finely chopped salted peanuts

Preheat the oven to 200F. Line two cookie sheets with parchment paper. Position racks in upper and lower thirds of the oven. In the bowl of a heavy duty mixer fitted with the whisk attachment (or a bowl if using a hand mixer with beaters), combine the egg whites and cream of tartar. Beat at medium-high speed (or high speed if using a hand mixer) until the egg whites are creamy white and hold soft peaks when the beaters are lifted out of the bowl. Continue to beat on medium-high speed, adding sugar a little at a time, taking ~2 min in all, until the whites are glossy and stiff. When you lift the whisk out the bowl, the whites should hold stiff peaks. Scatter small spoonfuls of the peanut butter over the meringue. With a large rubber spatula, fold the peanut butter into meringue until streaky; you don't want it to be perfectly blended. Using two soup spoons, drop heaping tablespoons of meringue ~1 1/2" apart onto the lined cookie sheets. Sprinkle each meringue with a bit of chopped peanuts. Bake for 1-1 1/2 hr, rotating the pans from top to bottom and front to back halfway through baking. Turn off the heat and let the meringues cool completely in oven. Store the cookies in an airtight container as soon as they are cool. They will keep for ~2 weeks.
