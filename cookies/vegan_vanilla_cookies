Vegan Vanilla Bean Cookies      gf

1 lb (4 sticks) vegan buttery baking sticks (earth balance recommended)
1/2 c sugar
2 finely ground vanilla beans
1 c finely ground blanched almonds (almond meal)
5 c flour

Cream baking sticks, sugar, vanilla beans, and almonds. Mix or knead in the flour. Shape dough into desired shape, roll in granulated sugar and place on ungreased cookie sheet. Bake ~10 min in 350F oven.


Notes: This is essentially a shortbread so don't make cookies too thick else you will need to decrease oven temp and increase cook time.
Also, works perfectly fine with real butter.
