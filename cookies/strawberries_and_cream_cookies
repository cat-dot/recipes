Strawberries and Cream Cookies
  --Christina, scientificallysweet.com

1/2 c (113g) unsalted butter, melted and cooled
1/2 c (110g) packed light brown sugar
1/4 c (50g) sugar
1 tsp (5ml) vanilla
1 large egg yolk
1 1/3 c (190g) ap flour
1/2 tsp salt
1/4 tsp baking soda
1/4 tsp baking powder
3/4 c (113g) white chocolate chips
3/4 c (105g) chopped fresh strawberries

Preheat your oven to 350F. Line tow large cookie sheets with parchment paper. Combine cooled melted butter, brown sugar, sugar and vanilla in a large bowl and whisk well until combined. Whisk in egg yolk until the mixture looks glossy like butterscotch sauce. Combine flour with baking soda, baking powder and salt in a medium bowl and whisk to blend evenly. Add it to the butter mixture. Fold it in until evenly combined. Add white chocolate chips and fold them in, then add the chopped fresh strawberries and fold them in gently. You actually don’t need to be too gentle here – strawberries are quite sturdy. Mix them in well and you’ll see that the moisture from the strawberries will soften up the cookie dough and make it easier to scoop. Scoop mounds of dough onto prepared baking sheets and press a few extra strawberry pieces on top. Bake for 15-20 min until golden brown. These cookies take longer to bake due to the moisture of the strawberries. Let them cool for 3 min on the baking sheets and then transfer to a wire rack to finish cooling.
