Hazelnut Cookies
  --Moira Hodgson

6 oz unskinned lightly toasted hazelnuts
2 tbsp vegetable oil
6 tbsp unsalted butter, at room temperature
1/2 c dark brown sugar, packed
1/3 c sugar
1 large egg
1/2 tsp vanilla 
1 c flour
1/2 tsp baking soda
Pinch of salt

Preheat oven to 350F. Place the hazelnuts in a food processor and grind coarsely. Reserve 1/4 c of the hazelnuts. Grind the remaining nuts fine and add the oil. Blend the mixture thoroughly into a hazelnut butter. Set aside. Cream the butter and sugars together until light and fluffy (this can be done in the washed food processor or with an electric mixer in a bowl). Beat in the hazelnut butter, the egg and the vanilla. Mix thoroughly. Sift the flour and add with the baking soda and the salt. Mix thoroughly and add the reserved hazelnuts. Using a tsp, form the dough into balls and arrange them 2" apart on baking sheets that have been greased or lined with parchment paper. Using the prongs of a fork that have been dipped into flour to prevent sticking, flatten the balls into 1 1/2" rounds (Tip: If you want a clearly visible criss-cross design on the cookies, chill dough for 30 min before doing so). Bake in the middle of the oven for 8-9 min or until the cookies are golden. Cool on racks. The cookies will keep for about a week in a sealed jar. 


Notes: For best results chill dough for an hour or up to overnight before baking. Dip in melted chocolate
