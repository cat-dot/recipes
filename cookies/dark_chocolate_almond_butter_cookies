Dark Chocolate Almond Butter Cookies
  --Sally McKenney

1 large egg
1 c (250g) creamy almond butter, at room temperature*
1/2 c (90g) lightly packed light or dark brown sugar (or coconut sugar)
1 tsp baking soda
1/4 c (21g) natural unsweetened cocoa powder
1 c (180g) dark chocolate chunks or chocolate chips
optional: 1/3 c chocolate candy-coated sunflower seeds

Preheat oven to 350F (177C) and line 2 large baking sheets with parchment paper or silicone baking mats. In a medium bowl, whisk the egg until beaten. With a big spoon or silicone spatula, or using an electric mixer, mix in/beat on medium speed the almond butter, then the brown sugar, baking soda, and cocoa powder. Beat/mix everything together very well. Depending how thick your almond butter is, you’ll have to use some arm muscle! Fold in the chocolate chunks until combined. Scoop the dough, ~1.5 tbsp of dough each (I use this medium-size cookie scoop), onto prepared baking sheets and arrange 3" apart. Gently press down on the dough mounds with the back of a spoon. If you find the cookie dough balls are a little oily from the almond butter (mine usually are) blot each with a paper towel. If using the sunflower seeds as pictured above, press several into the tops of each cookie dough mound before baking. Bake for 10 min. The cookies will look very soft and that’s expected. For firmer cookies, bake for 12 min. Cool cookies for 5 min on the baking sheet. During this time, I like to press a few more chocolate chips into the tops of the warm cookies. (This is optional and only for looks.) Transfer to cooling rack to cool completely.


Notes: don't use Dutch process cocoa
