  --Ana's Way

topping:
1 1/2 tbsp  sugar
1/4 tsp ground cinnamon

Combine in a small bowl and set aside.

cookies:
1/4 c natural peanut butter
2 tbsp margarine (or vegan butter + 1 tbsp extra of vegan milk)
1/4 c  sugar
1/4 cup brown sugar
1 tsp vanilla 
1 tbsp vegan milk of choice
1/2 c ap flour
1/2 tsp baking soda
1/2 tsp cream of tartar
pinch of sea salt

In a medium bowl whisk together the peanut butter, margarine, sugars, vanilla, and milk until creamy. Add the flour, baking soda, cream of tartar, salt, and mix with a spatula until the dough forms (do not over-mix!). Preheat the oven to 350F. With the help of a spoon portion the dough into 12 pieces and roll in between your palms to form small balls. Roll each ball in the cinnamon sugar and place on a parchment-lined baking sheet at least 2" apart. Press each cookie down lightly with your fingers. Bake for 11-13 min on the top rack of the oven (make sure you do not overbake). The cookies should still be soft in the center. Let them cool on the sheet for 10 min and transfer to a cooling rack. 



Notes: I used gf ap flour and doubled the recipe
