Gluten Free Chocolate Chip Cookies
  --Erin Collins

1 stick butter (1/2 c)
1 tbsp milk, or almond milk
3/4 c brown sugar
1/4 c white sugar
1 egg
2 tsp vanilla
1 1/3 cu gluten-free ap flour (7.5 oz)
1/4 c almond flour, 1 oz
1 tsp baking soda
1/2 teaspotspon salt
1 c chocolate chips
Sea salt for sprinkling, optional

In a medium bowl, whisk together the gluten-free flour, almond flour, baking soda and salt until evenly combined. Set aside. Melt butter in a saucepan over medium heat. Once the butter is melted start to whisk constantly. First the butter will begin to foam, then after a couple of minutes it will begin to brown on the bottom of the saucepan. Turn off the heat as soon as the solids turn brown and the butter gives off a nutty aroma. Pour into a glass mixing bowl to prevent burning. Add the milk, brown sugar and white sugar. Whisk to combine. Add the egg and vanilla and whisk until smooth and creamy. Using a rubber spatula, mix in the dry ingredients until well combined. Stir in the chocolate chips. Cover the bowl and let sit for 30 min. Preheat the oven to 350F. Scoop the cookie dough (~2 tbsp of dough per cookie) and place a few inches apart on the baking sheets. Bake for 10-12 min, until golden and the center is set. Let cool 5 minutes then transfer to a wire rack to continue cooling. 


Notes: To make nut free, sub 1/4 c gf ap flour for the almond flour. To make these dairy-free use earth balance buttery sticks and reduce the amount of almond milk to 1 tsp.
