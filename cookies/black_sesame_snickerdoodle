Black Sesame Snickerdoodle
  -- Jenny (GIR)

8 oz (1 c/2 sticks) unsalted butter, at room temperature
1 1/2 c granulated sugar
1 tbsp brown sugar
2 eggs, at room temperature
1 tsp vanilla extract or vanilla paste
2 3/4 c ap flour
1 tsp baking soda
2 tsp cream of tartar
1 tsp kosher salt
1/2 tsp ground cinnamon
1/3 c granulated sugar (for coating)
1 tsp black sesame seed paste

Cream the butter and both sugars in the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with the paddle attachment until light and fluffy. Scrape down the sides of the bowl and then add the eggs and vanilla and beat until well combined. In a separate bowl, whisk together the flour, baking soda, cream of tartar, salt, and cinnamon. Add the flour mixture to the creamed butter and eggs and mix until JUST combined. Line a baking sheet with a baking mat and using a 4 tbsp (2 oz) cookie scoop, scoop the cookie dough onto the prepared sheet. Refrigerate for 1 hr. In a small bowl, whisk together the sugar and black sesame paste until combined and no lumps of black sesame paste remain. Roll each cookie dough ball liberally in the black sesame sugar. Preheat oven to 400F. Line 2 baking sheets with parchment paper and arrange 6 cookies on each sheet. Return one sheet to the fridge (only bake 1 sheet at a time). Bake the cookies for 13-14 min, until the edges are just barely golden brown and the middle is puffed up. Repeating with the remaining tray. Once baked, transfer the sheet to a cooling rack and after 10 min, use a spatula to transfer the cookies to the cooling rack. Allow them to cool completely.
