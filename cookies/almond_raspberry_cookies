  --America's Test Kitchen

2 c (10 oz) ap flour
1 1/4 c slivered almonds
1/2 c (3 1/2 oz) granulated sugar + 1/2 c for coating
16 tbsp unsalted butter, cut into 1/2" pieces and chilled
1 tsp vanilla
1/2 c raspberry jam

Process 1 c flour and almonds in foor processor until almonds are finely groundm ~1 min. Add 1/2 c sugar and remaining 1 c flour and process until combined. Add butter and vanilla and pulse until dough forms. Transfer dough to lightly floured worksurface and roll to 1/4" thick. Using 2" round cookie cutter, cut dough into circles; space circles 2" apart on prepared sheets. Gently reroll scraps, cut into cirlse and transfer to sheets. Bake until edges are light brown, ~15 min, switching and rotating sheets halfway through baking. Let cookies cool on sheets for 5 min, then transfer to rack. Place remaining 1/2 c sugar in bowl. Working quickly, spread 1 tsp jam over bottom half of warm cookies, then top with remaining cookies, pressing lightly to adhere. Gently toss cookies in sugar to coat and transfer to rack. Let cookies cool completely before serving.


Notes: Sliced blanched almonds can be substituted for slivered. I'm also thinking almond meal might work (have to try)
