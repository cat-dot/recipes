  --America's Test Kitchen

1 c (5 oz) ap flour
3/4 tsp table salt
1/2 tsp baking soda
1/4 tsp ground cinnamon
3/4 c (5 1/4 oz) dark brown sugar
1/2 c (3 1/2 oz) granulated sugar
1/2 c vegetable oil
4 tbsp unsalted butter, melted and cooled
1 large egg + 1 large yolk
1 tsp vanilla extract
3 c (9 oz) old-fashioned rolled oats
1/2 c raisins

Adjust toaster oven rack to middle position and heat oven to 350F. Line large and small rimmed baking sheets with parchment paper. Whisk flour, salt, baking soda, and cinnamon together in bowl. Whisk brown sugar and granulated sugar together in medium bowl. Whisk in oil and melted butter until combined. Whisk in egg and yolk and vanilla until smooth. Gently stir in flour mixture with rubber spatula until soft dough forms. Fold in oats and raisins until evenly distributed (mixture will be stiff). Working with 3 tbsp dough at a time, roll into balls. Space desired number of dough balls at least 1 1/2" apart on prepared small sheet; space remaining dough balls evenly on prepared large sheet. Using bottom of greased dry measuring cup, press each ball until 2 1/2" in diameter. Bake small sheet of cookies until edges are just beginning to brown and centers are still soft but not wet, 10-15 min. Let cookies cool slightly on sheet. Serve warm or at room temperature. Makes 16 cookies


Note: Freeze large sheet of cookies until firm, ~1 hr. Transfer cookies to 1â€‘gallon zipper-lock bag and freeze for up to 1 month. Bake frozen cookies as directed; do not thaw. The number of cookies you can bake at one time will depend on the size of your baking sheet. Do not use extra-thick rolled oats; they will be tough.
