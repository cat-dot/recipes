Sqirl's Salted Chocolate Cookies

2 c ap flour
2/3 c unsweetened cocoa powder
1 1/2 tsp baking powder
pinch fine sea salt
1 c (2 stick) room temp unsalted butter
3/4 c light brown sugar
1/3 c + 1 tbsp granulated sugar
1 tsp vanilla
9 oz valrhona chocoalte (70-85% cacao) roughly chopped
fleur de sel for garnish

In a large bowl, combine the flour, cocoa powder, baking soda, and salt. In a stand mixer fitted with the paddle attachment, cream the butter, sugars, and vanilla until extremely fluffy, 5-7 min. Add the flour mixture and mix until a smooth dough forms, then fold in the chocoalte. Wrap the bowl with plastic wrap and refrigerate overnight. Preheat oven to 350F and line 2 sheet pans with parchment paper. Shape the cookie dough into 1 1/4oz (2 tbsp) balls, then place them 2" apart onto the prepared sheet pans. Sprinkle each with a pinch of fleur de sel. Bake, rotating halfway through, 11 min, then remove from the oven. While they're still hot, use a 2 3/4" round cookie cutter to make the cookies perfectly round. Let completely cool, then serve.
