Chocolate Chip Cookies
  --Chris Morocco
  
1 1/2 c (200g) ap flour
3/4 tsp  (2g) kosher salt
3/4 tsp (4g) baking soda)
3/4 c (1 1/2 sticks; 169g) unsalted butter, divided
1 c (200g) packed dark brown sugar
1/4 c (50g) sugar
1 large egg
2 large egg yolks
2 tsp vanilla
6 oz (170g) bittersweet chocolate (60-70% cacao) coarsly chopped (or semisweet chips)

Place racks in upper and lower thirds of oven; preheat to 375F. Whisk flour, salt, and baking soda in small bowl; set aside. Cook 1/2 c (1 stick; 113g) butter in a large saucepan over medium heat, swirling often and scraping bottom of pan with heatproof rubber spatula, until butter foams, then browns, ~4 min. Transfer butter to a large heatproof bowl and let cool 1 min. Cut remaining butter into small pieces and add to brown butter (it should start to melt, but not foam and sizzle). Once butter is melted, add both sugars and whisk, breaking up any clumps, until sugar is incorporated and no lumps remain. Add egg and yolks and whisk until sugar dissolves and mixture is smooth, ~30 s. Whisk in vanilla. Using rubber spatula, fold reserved dry ingredients into butter mixture just until no dry spots remain, then fold in chocolate. The dough will be soft but hsould hold its shape once scooped; if it slumps or oozes after being scooped, stir dough back together several times and let rest 5-10 min. Using a 1 1/2 oz (3 tbsp) scoop, portion out 16 balls of dough and divide between 2 parchment lined baking sheets. Bake cookies, rotating only if browning unevenly, until deep golden brown and firm around the edges, 8-10 min. Let cool on baking sheets.
