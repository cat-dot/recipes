Coconut Macaoons
  --Jennifer Segal

14 oz bag sweetened flaked coconut (~5 1/3c)
7/8 c sweetened condensed milk
1 tsp vanilla
2 large egg whites
1/4 tsp salt
4 oz semi-sweet chocolate (optional)

Preheat oven to 325F. Set 2 oven racks near the center of the oven. Line 2 baking sheets with parchment paper. In a medium bowl, mix the coconut, milk, and vanilla; set aside. In the bowl of an electric mixer, beat the egg whites and salt until stiff peaks form. Use a large soft spatula to fold the egg whites into the coconut mixture. Using 2 spoons, form heaping tbsp of the mixture into mounds on the prepared baking sheets, spacing ~1" apart. Bake for 23-25 min, rotating the pans halfway. Let cool on the pans for a few minutes, then transfer to a wire rack to cool completely. If dipping in chocolate, melt the chocolate in a microwave safe bowl at medium power, stopping and stirring every 30 s, just until smooth and creamy. Dip the bottoms of the macaroons in the chocolate and return to the lined baking sheets. Place in refrigerator for ~10 min to allow the chocolate to set. The cookies will keep in an airtight container at room temp for ~1 week. Makes ~26
