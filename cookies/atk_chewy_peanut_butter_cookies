Chewy Peanut Butter Cookies
  --America's Test Kitchen
  
1 1/2 c (7 1/2 oz) ap flour
1 tsp baking soda
1/2 tsp table salt
1 1/2 c packed (10 1/2 oz) dark brown sugar
1 c (9 oz) creamy peanut butter
2 large eggs
4 tbsp unsalted butter, melted and cooled
2 tbsp honey
1 tsp vanilla extract
1/2 c unsalted dry-roasted peanuts, chopped fine

Adjust oven rack to middle position and heat oven to 350 F. Line two 18x13" rimmed baking sheets with parchment paper. Whisk flour, baking soda, and salt together in medium bowl. In large bowl, whisk sugar, peanut butter, eggs, melted butter, honey, and vanilla until smooth. Add flour mixture and stir with rubber spatula until soft, homogeneous dough forms. Stir in peanuts until evenly distributed. Working with 2 tbsp dough at a time (or using #30 portion scoop), roll dough into balls and evenly space on prepared sheets (12 dough balls per sheet). Using your fingers, gently flatten dough balls until 2" in diameter. Bake cookies, 1 sheet at a time, until edges are just set and just beginning to brown, 10-12 min, rotating sheet after 6 min. Let cookies cool on sheet for 5 min. Using wide metal spatula, transfer cookies to wire rack and let cool completely before serving.


Notes: To ensure that the cookies have the proper texture, use a traditional creamy peanut butter in this recipe; do not substitute crunchy or natural peanut butter. We developed this recipe with Skippy Creamy Peanut Butter.
