Thumbprint Cookies
  --Lindsay Funston

1 3/4 c ap flour
1/2 tsp baking powder
1/2 tsp kosher salt
3/4 c (1 1/2 sticks) butter, softened
1/2 c granulated sugar
1 large egg
1 tsp vanilla 
1/3 c. assorted jams, for filling cookies

Preheat oven to 350F and line two baking sheets with parchment. In a bowl, whisk together flour, baking powder, and salt. In another bowl, beat butter and sugar until pale and fluffy, ~3 minutes. Beat in egg and vanilla, then add dry ingredients in 2 batches until incorporated. Using a small cookie scoop, scoop 1” balls onto prepared baking sheets. Press a thumbprint into center of each ball, 1/2” deep. Fill with a small spoonful of jam. Bake until edges of cookies are golden, 13-14 min. Cool on baking sheets before serving.


Notes: Dough is very sticky, chill before scooping out onto sheets kind of helps. Only baked for 11-12 min in my oven so ymmv
