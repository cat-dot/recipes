Low FODMAP Oatmeal Cookies
  --Rachel Pauls Food

1/2 c (8 tbsp) unsalted butter or vegan margarine for dairy-free version; can also substitute vegetable shortening, but this will result in a crisper cookie)
1/2 c brown sugar
1/2 c granulated white sugar
1 large egg
2 tsp pure vanilla extract
1 cup low-FODMAP, gluten-free flour (Authentic Foods GF Classical Blend- best for low-FODMAP flour for baking)
1 teaspoon baking powder
1/2 t xanthan gum, if not already added to your flour choice
1/2 tsp baking soda
1/4 tsp salt
1/4 tsp cinnamon
1 c gf traditional rolled oats
1 c craisins/chocolate chips/chopped walnuts/raisins/chopped pecans (optional)

Place rack in center of oven, preheat to 350F; prep baking sheets with grease or parchment/silicone mat. In large bowl of electric mixer with flat paddle, beat butter/vegan spread and sugars until light and fluffy. Add egg and vanilla and mix on low-medium speed until well combined, scraping down bowl as necessary. In a separate medium bowl, whisk together flour, baking powder, baking soda, xanthan gum (if using), salt, and cinnamon. Slowly add dry ingredients to the mixing bowl and combine on low until doughy. Fold in oats and optional stir-ins by hand. Drop by heaped teaspoons onto cookie sheet ~1" apart as they will spread; bak for 10-15 min. If making larger cookies, may need to increase baking time slightly. Cool on cookie-sheet until bottoms are firm - they will be delicate when first out of the oven. Store in air-tight container for 2-3 days or freeze.


Notes: Used coconut oil (also low-FODMAP) and 1/2 tsp cinnamon
