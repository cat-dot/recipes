  --Dr. Rachel Paul
  
Cookies:
2 & 3/4 c ap low-FODMAP gluten-free flour (req: Authentic Foods GF Classical Blend)
3/4 tsp xanthan gum (omit if using low-FODMAP flour brand with included xanthan gum)
1 tsp cream of tartar
1/2 tsp baking soda
1/4 tsp salt
1 1/2 c white sugar
1/2 c butter or low-FODMAP dairy-free alternative, softened (ex. Earth Balance vegan spread)
1 tsp vanilla extract
2 large eggs

Preheat oven to 400F. Line baking sheets with parchment paper or silicone liners. In a small bowl, whisk together the flour, xanthan gum (if needed), cream of tartar, baking soda, and salt. In the bowl of your standing mixer with flat paddle attachment, beat the sugar and butter or vegan spread until well mixed. Add the egg and vanilla and mix again at medium speed. Add the dry ingredients into your mixing bowl and mix on low until just combined. Cover the dough and place in fridge to chill for 1 hr or up to 2 days. When ready to use, remove from fridge to soften until you can roll easily.

Topping:
2 tbsp white sugar
1 1/2 tsp cinnamon

Combine in a small bowl. Roll dough into ~1" balls and place in sugar/cinnamon mixture to coat sides. Lay on baking sheet ~2" apart. Bake 8-10 min or until set. Cool on a cooling rack.
