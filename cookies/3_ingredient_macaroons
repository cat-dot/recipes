3 Ingredient Macaroons
  --fitmencook.com

3 egg whites, room temp
2 1/8 c unsweetened shredded coconut
5 tbsp xylitol or Swerve
1 tsp cinnamon or favorite aromatic spice (optional)

Set oven to 400F. To a large bowl, use a hand blender (or by hand) to whisk egg whites until peaks form.  Note: try as much as possible to have very little to no liquid egg white remaining in the bowl. Slowly add coconut and xylitol, gently folding little by little using a spatula. If desired, add the spices here or sprinkle on top before baking. Line a baking tray with parchment. Use an ice cream scooper or a spoon to carve out at least 15 equally sized mounds of coconut and place on the baking tray. Repeat until all the batter is gone. Bake for 12-15 min or until outside is golden and the edges are lightly browned. After baking let them first cool on the baking tray for a few min, AND then place in the fridge to further cool down and harden. Store these in an airtight container in the fridge for 1 week.



Notes: I made ~21 or so; 400F was too hot in my oven, they got very brown at 10 min. I used ground cardamom and could not taste it - not sure if more than a tsp would help there.
