  --America's Test Kitchen
  
1 2/3 c slivered almonds
1 1/3 c (9 1/3 oz) sugar
2 large egg whites
1 c pine nuts

Adjust oven racks to upper-middle and lower-middle positions and heat oven to 375 F. Line 2 rimmed baking sheets with parchment paper. Process almonds and sugar in food processor until finely ground, ~30 s. Add egg whites and process until smooth, ~20 s. (Dough will be sticky.) Transfer dough to large bowl. Place pine nuts in separate shallow bowl. Spray 1-tbsp measuring spoon with vegetable oil spray. Working with 1 rounded tbsp dough at a time, shape into balls and roll balls in pine nuts until evenly coated. Place 9 balls on each prepared sheet, spaced 2" apart. Bake cookies until light golden brown, 14-16 min, switching and rotating sheets halfway through baking. Let cookies cool completely on sheets. Serve. (Cookies can be stored in airtight container for several days.)
 

Notes: If desired, the cookies can be dusted with confectionersâ€™ sugar just after they come out of the oven.
