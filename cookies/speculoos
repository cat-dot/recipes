Speculoos (Belgian spice cookies)
  --America's Test Kitchen (mostly)

1 1/2 c ap flour
5 tsp cinnamon
1 tsp ground cardamon
1/4 tsp ground clove
1/4 tsp baking powder
1/4 tsp baking soda
1/4 tsp salt
3/4 c turbinado sugar
8 tbsp unsalted butter, chilled and cut into 1" cubes
1 egg

Whisk flour, spices, salt, baking powder, and baking soda together in a bowl; set aside. Process sugar in food processor for 30 s. Add butter and process for another 30 s. Add egg and process for ~10 s. Add dry ingredients and process for ~30 s. Pour dough out into a bowl, and knead with rubber spatula to make sure all flour is combined. Turn dough out onto parchment, cover with a second piece, and roll out to a 10x12" rectangle, 3/8" thick. Refrigerate dough for 90 min. Preheat oven to 300F; cut dough into even rectangles, moving quickly so that it doesn't warm up. Place cookies on rimless baking sheets, with enough room for air to circulate around the cookies. Bake for 30-32 min. Remove from oven and let coot on racks at least 20 min before removing from pans.


Notes: drawing a template on parchment makes it easier to cut evenly sized cookies
