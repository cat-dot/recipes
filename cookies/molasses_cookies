  - America's Test Kitchen

1/3 c (2 1/2 oz) granulated sugar + 1/2 c for dipping
2 1/2 c (11 1/4 oz) ap flour
1 tsp baking soda
1 1/2 tsp cinnamon
1 1/2 tsp ground ginger
1/2 tsp ground cloves
1/4 tsp ground allspice
1/4 tsp ground black pepper
1/4 tsp salt
12 tbsp unsalted butter (1 1/2 sticks) softened but cool
1/3 c (2 1/2 oz) dark brown sugar
1 large egg yolk
1 tsp vanilla
1/2 c (6 oz) molasses light or dark

Adjust the oven rack to middle position and preheat oven to 375F. Line 2 baking sheets with parchment paper. Place 1/2 c sugar for dipping in 8 or 9" cake pan. Whisk flour, baking soda, spices, and salt in medium bowl until thoroughly combined; set aside. In standing mixer fitted with paddle attachment, beat butter with brown and granulated sugars at medium-high speed until light and fluffy,~3 min. Reduce speed to medium-low and add yolk and vanilla; increase speed to medium and beat until incorporated, ~ 20 s. Reduce speed to medium-low and add molasses; beat until fully incorporated ~20 s, scraping bottom and sides of bowl once with rubber spatula. Reduce speed to lowest setting; add flour mixture and beat until just incorporated, ~30 s, scraping bowl down once. Give dough final stir with rubber spatula to ensure that no pockets of flour remain at bottom. Dough will be soft. Using tablespoon measure, scoop heaping tablespoon of dough and roll between palms into 1 1/2" ball; drop ball into cake pan with sugar and repeat to form ~4 balls. Toss in sugar to coat and set on prepared baking sheet, spacing ~2" apart. Repeat with remaining dough. Bake 1 sheet at a time until cookies are browned, still puffy, and edges have begun to set but centers are still soft, ~11 min, rotating halfway through baking. Cool on sheet 5 min before transferring to wire rack. 

Glaze:
1 c (4 1/2 oz) confectioners' sugar
2 1/2-3 tbsp dark rum

When cookies completely cool, return to parchment lined sheet. Whisk sugar and rum in medium bowl until smooth. If the glaze is too thick, whisk in another tbsp rum. Dip spoon into glaze and drizzle over cookies. Transfer back to rack and allow glaze to dry 10-15 min.
