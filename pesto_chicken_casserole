Pesto Chicken Penne Casserole
  --Lindalou, allrecipes

1/2 c seasoned bread crumbs
1/2 c grated Parmesan cheese
1 tbsp olive oil
16 oz box penne pasta
6 c cubed cooked chicken
4 c shredded Italian cheese blend
3 c fresh baby spinach
15 oz can crushed tomatoes
15 oz jar alfredo sauce
15 oz jar pesto sauce
1 1/2 c milk

Preheat an oven to 350F (175C). Grease a 9x13" baking dish. Combine the bread crumbs, Parmesan cheese, and olive oil in a small bowl until evenly moistened; set aside. Fill a large pot with lightly salted water and bring to a rolling boil over high heat. Once the water is boiling, stir in the penne, and return to a boil. Cook the pasta uncovered, stirring occasionally, until the pasta has cooked through, but is still firm to the bite, ~11 min. Drain well in a colander set in the sink. Meanwhile, combine the chicken in a bowl with the Italian cheese blend, spinach, tomatoes, alfredo sauce, pesto sauce, and milk. Stir in the pasta once done, and scoop into the prepared baking dish. Top with the bread crumb mixture. Bake in the preheated oven until bubbly and golden brown on top, 40-45 min.


Notes: Can make your own pesto and/or alfredo, just use 2 c in place of jar. I didn't have spinach on hand, used frozen broccoli florets. Also used panko bread crumbs and sundried tomato pesto - very tasty. Swapped monterey jack + pecorino romano for the "Italian blend". Ended up using 1 1/2 cassreole dishes.
