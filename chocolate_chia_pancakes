Chocolate Chia Pancakes
  --Fresh Made NYC

1/2 tsp salt
1/4 c quinoa flour
3/4 c oat flour
1 tbsp chia seeds
2 tbsp coconut palm sugar
cacao sweet nibs
2 tsp baking powder
1 c vanilla almond milk
2 tbsp olive oil
1 large egg
1 tsp cinnamon
1 tsp vanilla

To a blender add milk, egg, oil, and vanilla. Next add flour, sugar, baking powder, salt, chia, and cinnamon. Blend on high until all ingredients are just incorporated; scrape down sides as needed. Heat a large cast iron pan or skillet over medium heat. Pour batter directly from blender into the pan, creating the size of pancake you wish to make. Sprinkle in a few nibs (or dark chocolate chips). Cook until the holes bubble on top of the pancake, flip with a spatula, and cook for another minute or 2. Transfer to a plate or put on a baking sheet and keep warm in a 200F oven.
Makes 12-15 pancakes.
