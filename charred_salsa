Charred Tomato Salsa

1 lb (4 medium) plum tomatoes
2 jalapeno peppers
2 garlic cloves
1/2 white onion, cut into 4 wedges
1/4 c roughly chopped cilantro
2 tbsp lime juice
1 tsp agave
kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper to taste

Heat a cast iron skillet over high heat. Working in batches, sear the tomatoes, jalapenos, garlic, and onion until charred all over, 5 min for tomatoes & garlic, 8 min for jalapenos and onion. Transfer all the charred vegetables to the bowl of a food processor and let cool complete. Add the cilantro, lime juice, and agave, then pulse until a chunky puree forms. Season with salt and pepper, transfer to a bowl and serve.
