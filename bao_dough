Bao Dough

2/3 c warm water
2 tsp instant yeast
2 tbsp sugar
1 tbsp canola oil
1 1/4 c bread flour + more if needed
1 tsp koser salt

In a small bowl, whisk together the water, yeast, and sugar until the yeast dissolves. Let the mixture sit until the yeast starts to get foamy and bloom, 4-6m. Stir in the oil and set aside.
Meanwhile, sift the bread flour, salt, and baking soda together. Add the yeast mixture to the dry ingredients and stir using a rubber spatula. If the dough looks sticky, add 1 additional tbsp of flour at a time until it is less sticky. Turn the dough onto a lightly floured work surface and knead until smooth. Cover the dough with a damp kitchen towel and let the dough rest until it has doubled in size, 1 1/2-2hrs. Punch the dough down to flatten it. Portion the dough into balls that are 2" in diameter and let rest for 5 min. Flatten each ball into a disk 3" in diameter. Fill the buns with a filling of your choice and wrap by gathering the edge and twisting slightly. Cover with a damp kitchen towl to keep the bao from drying out. Place the buns in a steam basket lined with parchment paper and steam until the buns have expande, 7-9 min.
