Banana Bread

2 c sugar
2 c flour
3/4 tsp baking soda
3/4 tsp nutmeg
1 tsp salt
1 tsp baking powder
3 eggs
4 overripe bananas
14 tbsp unsalted butter, melted + more for greasing pan

Preheat oven to 350F. Greas a 10"x5"x3 1/2" loaf pan and set aside. In a large bowl, combine the sugar, flour, baking soda, nutmeg, salt, and baking powder. In a separate bowl, beat the eggs and combine with the mashed bananas. Pour the wet ingredients over the dry ingredients and mix together until just combined. Stir in the melted butter until fully incorporated. Pour the batter into prepared pan and bake until golden brown and a cake tester inserted in the center of loaf comes out clean, ~70min. Alloe to cool for 20 min before slicing.
