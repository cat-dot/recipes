Heirlom Tomato Galette

Dough:
3 c ap flour
1 1/4 tsp kosher salt
1 tsp granulated sugar
1 1/2 sticks unsalted butter, cold and cubed
3/4 c ice water

In a medium bowl, whisk together the flour, salt, and sugar. Using your fingers, work the butter into the mixture until pea sized pieces form. Add the water and continue to knead until a dough forms. Cover the dough with plastic wrap and let rest in the refrigerator for 30 min.

Tomato Jam:
2 tbsp olive oil
1/4 c tomato paste
2 medium (10 oz) plum tomatoes, diced
1 tbsp lemon juice
1 tbsp honey
kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper to taste

In a small saucepan, heat the oil over medium high heat. Add the tomato paste and cook until caramelized, 2-3 min. Add the remaining ingredients and cook until the tomatoes have broken down and reduced to 1/2 c, 13-15 min. Using an immersion blender, puree until thick, then let cool completely.

Galette:
1/4 c grated parmesan
tomato jam
1 1/2 lbs heirloom tomatoes, sliced 1/4" thick
kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper to taste
1/4 c (4 oz) glue cheese, crumbled in large chunks
2 tbsp (2 oz) goat cheese, crumbled
1 egg, beaten
flaky sea salt for garnish
thyme, mint, and basil leaves for garnish

Preheat oven to 375F. Roll out the dough into an 18" circle, 1/6" thick. Transfer to a sheet of parchment paper and sprinkle the parmesan over the center of the crust. Spread the jam to form a thin layer on the dough, leaving a 2" outer border clear. Arrange the tomato slices over the jam and season with salt and pepper, then dot with the blur and goat cheeses. Fold the outer 1/2" dough over itself to form an even lip around the galette, then begin to fold the dough over the tomatoes, forming a series of pleats. Brush the outside crust liberally with the beaten egg. Bake until the galette is golden brown, 45-55 min. Let cool completely, then garnish with flaky sea salt and the herbs. Slice and serve.
