Korean Fried Chicken Wings
  --America's Test Kitchen

1 tbsp toasted sesame oil
1 tsp garlic, minced to paste
1 tsp grated fresh ginger
1 3/4 c water
3 tbsp sugar
2-3 tbsp gochujang
1 tbsp shoyu
2 qt vegetable oil
1 c ap flour
3 tbsp cornstarch
3 lb chicken wings, cut at joints, wingtips discarded

Combine sesame oil, garlic, and ginger in large bowl and microwave until mixture is bubbly and garlic and ginger are fragrant but not browned, 40-60 s. Whisk in 1/4 c water, sugar, gochujang, and shoyu until smooth; set aside. Heat vegetable oil in dutch oven over medium high heat to 350F. While oil heats, whisk flour, cornstarch, and remaining 1 1/2 c water in second large bowl until smooth. Set wire rack in rimmed baking sheet and set aside. Place half of wings in batter and stir to coat. Using tongs, remove wings from batter one at a time, allowing any excess batter to drip back into bowl, and add to hot oil. Increase heat to high and cook, stirring occasionally to prevent wings from sticking, until coating is light golden and beginning to crisp, ~7 min. Transfer wings to prepared rack. Return oil to 350F and repeat with remaining wings. Reduce heat to medium and let second batch of wings rest for 5 min. Heat oil to 375F. Carefully return all wings to oil and cook, stirring occasionally, until deep golden brown and very crisp, ~7 min. Return wings to rack and let stand for 2 min. Transfer wings to reserved sauce and toss until coated. Return wings to rack and let stand for 2 min to allow coating to set. Transfer to platter and serve.
